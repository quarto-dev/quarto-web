## Installation

If you want to use an extension within a document or project you need to add it to a project or directory. Rather than installing into a global library, Quarto extensions are stored locally, directly alongside the document or project they are used within. For example, if you have a project in a directory named `myblog`, you could add some extensions for use with that the project as follows:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
cd myblog
quarto add quarto-ext/fontawesome
quarto add quarto-ext/video
```

This will result in an `_extensions` folder being created at the root of your project, and the `fontawesome` and `video` extensions being placed within it.

Note that a project isn't strictly required for using extensions---if you add extensions in a directory that isn't a project then any document located directly alongside the `_extensions` folder can use the extensions.

### Version Control

If you are using version control you should check the `_extensions` directory in to your repo along with your other code. Extensions used by a document or project are treated as source code to ensure very long term reproducibility---your project doesn't need to rely on the availability of an external package manager (or the maintenance of older extension versions) to successfully render now and far into the future.

## Repositories

The extensions in the example above were prefixed with `quarto-ext` because they were distributed from the [quarto-ext](https://github.com/quarto-ext/) GitHub organization. Extensions can be similarly distributed from **any** GitHub organization. So for example the following might also be valid command to add extensions to a project:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto add cooltools/lightbox
quarto add bigstateu/fancytweet
```

While it's convenient to distribute extensions using GitHub, you can also bundle them into a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive and distribute them using a URL or a local file. See the article on [Distributing Extensions](distributing.qmd) for additional details.

## Updating

You can list and update configured extensions for a given project with the following commands:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto list extensions
quarto update quarto-ext/fontawesome
```

Note that when updating an extension you'll be prompted to confirm the update based on the version you have and the version you are attempting to update to.

## Removing

Use this command to remove an extension from a project:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto remove quarto-ext/fontawesome
```

If you run the `quarto remove extension` command with no `extension-id`, you will be presented with a list of extensions that are present and you may select which extensions to remove.
