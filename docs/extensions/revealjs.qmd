## Overview

Revealjs plugins enable you to extend the capabilities of HTML presentations created with [Revealjs](../presentations/revealjs/). The Reveal Plugin API is very rich, and many of the built-in capabilities of Quarto Revealjs presentations are implemented as plugins, including [Menu](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/src/resources/formats/revealjs/plugins/menu), [Chalkboard](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/src/resources/formats/revealjs/plugins/chalkboard), and [PDF Export](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/src/resources/formats/revealjs/plugins/pdfexport).

Here are some examples of Revealjs plugins packaged as Quarto extensions:

| Extension                                                | Description                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Pointer](https://github.com/quarto-ext/pointer)         | Adds support for switching the cursor to a 'pointer' style element while presenting. |
| [Attribution](https://github.com/quarto-ext/attribution) | Display attribution text along the right edge of slides.                             |

## Quick Start

Here we'll describe how to create a simple Revealjs plugin extension. We'll use the `quarto create` command to do this. If you are using VS Code or RStudio you should execute `quarto create` within their repsective integrated Terminal panes. 

To get started, execute `quarto create extension revealjs-plugin` within the parent directory where you'd like the plugin extension to be created:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
$ quarto create extension revealjs-plugin
 ? Extension Name › shuffler
```

As shown above, you'll be prompted for an extension name. Type `shuffler` and press Enter---the Revealjs plugin extension is then created:

```bash
Creating extension at /Users/jjallaire/quarto/dev/shuffler:
  - Created README.md
  - Created _extensions/shuffler/_extension.yml
  - Created _extensions/shuffler/shuffler.css
  - Created _extensions/shuffler/shuffler.js
  - Created .gitignore
  - Created example.qmd
```

If you are running within VS Code or RStudio a new window will open with the extension project. 

Here's what the contents of the files in `_extensions/shuffler/` look like:

``` {.yaml filename="_extensions/shuffler/_extension.yml"}
title: Shuffler
author: J.J. Allaire
version: 1.0.0
quarto-required: ">=1.2.222"
contributes:
  revealjs-plugins:
    - name: RevealShuffler
      script:
        - shuffler.js
      stylesheet:
        - shuffler.css
```

``` {.lua filename="_extensions/shuffler/shuffler.js"}
window.RevealShuffler = function () {
  return {
    id: "RevealShuffler",
    init: function (deck) {
      // TODO: Implement your plugin functionality
      // Learn more at https://revealjs.com/creating-plugins/
      
      // This example shuffles the deck when the 'T' key is pressed
      deck.addKeyBinding({ keyCode: 84, key: "T" }, () => {
        deck.shuffle();
      });
    },
  };
};
```

There is also a `shuffler.css` file for providing any styles required by your plugin.

Finally, the `example.qmd` file includes code that exercises the extension. For example:

``` {.markdown filename="example.qmd"}
---
title: "Shuffler Example"
format:
  revealjs: default
revealjs-plugins:
  - shuffler
---

## Breakfast

- Eat eggs
- Drink coffee

## Dinner

- Eat spaghetti
- Drink wine
```

To develop your plugin, render/preview `example.qmd`, and then make changes to `shuffler.js` and `shuffler.css` (the preview will automatically refresh when you change these files).

## Installation and Use

If your extension source code it located within a GitHub repository, then it can be added by referencing the GitHub organization and repository name. For example, you can install the `attribution` extension with the following:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto add quarto-ext/attribution
```

Note that it is possible to bundle and distribute extensions as simple gzip archives (as opposed to using a GitHub repository as described above). See the article on [Distributing Extensions](distributing.qmd) for additional details.

Once an extension has been added, you can use the Reveal plugin by adding it to the `reveal-plugins` key. For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Presentation"
format: revealjs
revealjs-plugins:
  - attribution
---
```

## Plugin Packaging

Note that the plugins listed above were not initially developed for use with Quarto. Rather, they were developed intially as native Revealjs plugins and then packaged as Quarto extensions.

For example, you can find the original implementation of the attribution plugin here: <https://github.com/rschmehl/reveal-plugins/tree/main/attribution>. The plugin is implemented with a JavaScript file and a CSS file. To make the plugin available as a Quarto extension, we package these files along with an `_extension.yml` config file that registers the plugin. Here are the files in the Quarto extension:

``` bash
LICENSE
README.md
example.qmd
_extensions/
   attribution/
     _extension.yml
     attribution.js
     attribution.css
```

Note that the `LICENSE` and `README.md` are standard documentation files and the `example.qmd` is used for development and documentation of the extension. None of those files are actually installed by end users (rather only the contents of the `_extensions` directory is installed).

You can see the full source code of the Quarto version here: <https://github.com/quarto-ext/attribution> (we'll also walk through the code in detail below).

## Plugin Development

You can develop either entirely new Revealjs plugins from scratch or you can package existing Revealjs extensions as described above.

Here is a list of existing 3rd party plugins for Revealjs that you might consider packaging as Quarto extensions: <https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware>.

If you want to develop new plugins, check out the Quarto Reveal extensions listed above as well as the code of other 3rd party Reveal Plugins. The following documentation on the Revealjs website provides additional important technical details:

-   [API Methods](https://revealjs.com/api/)

-   [Reveal Events](https://revealjs.com/events/)

## Plugin Configuration

Some Revealjs plugins make available various user options. If you are developing a plugin from scratch, you should use a distinct key for your plugin's configuration. Users can use this key alongside other `revealjs` options. For example the `pointer` extension can be configured as follows:

``` yaml
---
title: "Example Presentation"
format:
  revealjs: 
    pointer:
      pointerSize: 18
      color: '#32cd32'
revealjs-plugins:
  - pointer
---
```

The extension accesses options using the `deck.getConfig()` function:

``` javascript
return {
  id: "pointer",
  init: (deck) => {
    const config = deck.getConfig();
    const options = config.pointer || {};
    // etc
  }
}
```

Note that when packaging an existing Revealjs plugin, you can override its default configuration using the `config` key within your `_extension.yml` file. For example, these are the overrides provided by the `pointer` extension:

``` yaml
title: Pointer
author: Charles Teague
contributes:
  revealjs-plugins:
    - name: RevealPointer
      script:
        - pointer.js
      stylesheet:
        - pointer.css
      config:
        pointer:
          key: "q"
          color: "red"
          pointerSize: 16
          alwaysVisible: false
```

## Example: Attribution

Here we'll walk through the complete source code for the [attribution](https://github.com/quarto-ext/attribution/) extension. This extension enables you to display attribution text sideways along the right edge of Revealjs slides.

Here are source files used to develop the extension:

``` bash
LICENSE
README.md
example.qmd
_extensions/
   attribution/
     _extension.yml
     attribution.js
     attribution.css
```

The `example.qmd` and documentation files are used for development of the the extension only (it is not installed by end users). The other files provide extension registration (`_extension.yml`) and the actual implementation of the Revealjs plugin (`attribution.js` and `attribution.css`).

The `example.qmd` is a simple one-slide presentation that includes an image along with a a div with class `.attribution`:

``` {.markdown filename="example.qmd"}
---
title: "Attribution Extension"
format: revealjs
revealjs-plugins:
  - attribution
---

Note that the `revealjs-plugins` key references the `attribution` extension, which will implemented in the `_extensions/attribution` directory.

The `_extension.yml` file indicates that the extension is making available a Revealjs plugin along with the plugin name, script, and style-sheets (note that the plugin name is not arbitrary, it will be whatever name is used within the script that implements the plugin, in this case `RevealAttribution`):

``` {.yaml filename="_extensions/attribution/_extension.yml"}
title: Attribution
author:  Roland Schmehl
version: 0.1.0
quarto-required: ">=1.2.0"
contributes:
  revealjs-plugins:
    - name: RevealAttribution
      script:
        - attribution.js
      stylesheet:
        - attribution.css
```

The `attribution.js` file contains the implementation of the Plugin using the Revealjs Plugin API:

``` {.javascript filename="_extensions/attribution/attribution.js"}
window.RevealAttribution = window.RevealAttribution || {
  id: 'RevealAttribution',
  init: function(deck) {
      initAttribution(deck);
  }
};

const initAttribution = function(Reveal){

var ready = false;
var resize = false;
var scale = 1;

window.addEventListener( 'ready', function( event ) {

  var content;

  // Remove configured margin of the presentation
  var attribution = document.getElementsByClassName("attribution");
  var width = window.innerWidth;
  var configuredWidth = Reveal.getConfig().width;
  var configuredHeight = Reveal.getConfig().height;

  scale = 1/(1-Reveal.getConfig().margin);

  for (var i = 0; i < attribution.length; i++) {
    content = attribution[i].innerHTML;
    attribution[i].style.width = configuredWidth + "px";
    attribution[i].style.height = configuredHeight + "px";
    attribution[i].innerHTML = "<span class='content'>" + content + "</span>";
    attribution[i].style.transform = 'translate( -50%, -50% ) scale( ' + scale*100 + '% ) rotate(-180deg)';
  }

  // Scale with cover class to mimic backgroundSize cover
  resizeCover();

});

window.addEventListener( 'resize', resizeCover );

function resizeCover() {

  // Scale to mimic backgroundSize cover
  var attribution = document.getElementsByClassName("attribution");
  var xScale = window.innerWidth / Reveal.getConfig().width;
  var yScale = window.innerHeight / Reveal.getConfig().height;
  var s = 1;

  if (xScale > yScale) {
      // The div fits perfectly in x axis, stretched in y
      s = xScale/yScale;
  }
  for (var i = 0; i < attribution.length; i++) {
    attribution[i].style.transform = 'translate( -50%, -50% ) scale( ' + s*scale*100 + '% ) rotate(-180deg)';
  }
}

};
```

Finally, `attribution.css` includes the CSS that repositions and rotates the element with class `.attribution` on the far right side of the slide:

``` {.css filename="_extensions/attribution/attribution.css"}
/* Attribution plugin: text along the right edge of the viewport */
.attribution{
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  bottom: auto;
  left: 50%;
  right: auto;
  font-size: 0.4em;
  pointer-events: none;
  text-align: center;
  writing-mode: vertical-lr;
  transform: translate( -50%, -50% ) scale( 100% ) rotate(-180deg);
}

/* Attribution plugin: activate pointer events for attribution text only */
.attribution .content{
  pointer-events: auto;
}
```
