This works perfectly well, but does have the disadvantage of being somewhat awkward to share across all documents within a project.\nIn Quarto documents, you can provide these options in YAML. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nknitr:\n  opts_chunk:\n    fig.width: 6\n    fig.height: 4\nr-options:\n  width: 70\n  digits: 5\n---\nNote that these options can also be provided on a per-format basis.\n\n\nCode Folding\nFor HTML output, Quarto enables you to specify that code is included in the document but hidden by default using the <details> tag. For example:\n\nTo specify that all chunks within a document should use code folding, use the code-fold option:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n---\nYou can also set code folding on a per-chunk basis with the fold attribute:\n```{r fold=TRUE}\nsummary(cars)\n```\nUse the code-summary option to provide a custom caption for the <details> tag:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n    code-summary: \"Show the code\"\n---\nYou can provide summary text per-cell with the summary attribute:\n```{r, summary=\"Show the code\"}\nsummary(cars)\n```\nIf you want all foldable code regions to be shown by default, use code-fold: show.

In addition, you can use quarto command line options (or their equivalent arguments to the quarto_render function) to control caching behavior without changing the document’s code.\nUse these command line options to force the use of caching on all chunks, disable the use of caching on all chunks, or to force a refresh of the cache even if it has not been invalidated:\n$ quarto render document.Rmd --cache \n$ quarto render document.Rmd --no-cache \n$ quarto render document.Rmd --cache-refresh \nOr from R using the quarto package:\nlibrary(quarto)\nquarto_render(\"document.Rmd\", cache = TRUE)\nquarto_render(\"document.Rmd\", cache = FALSE)\nquarto_render(\"document.Rmd\", cache_refresh = TRUE)\nYou can also specify these options within a document’s YAML metadata.
