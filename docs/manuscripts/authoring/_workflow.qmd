The basic workflow for writing a manuscript in Quarto is to make changes to your article content in `{{< meta article-file >}}`, preview the changes with Quarto, and repeat. Let's try it out.

Open a new Terminal in {{< meta tool.name >}} and run:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto preview
```

You'll see some output from Quarto on the Terminal:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
❯ quarto preview
Preparing to preview
[1/1] {{< meta article-file >}}
Rendering notebooks
[1/2] {{< meta article-file >}}
[2/2] notebooks/data-screening.ipynb

Watching files for changes
Browse at http://localhost:3806/
GET: /
```


And then, a browser window will open with a live preview of the manuscript. 

You may find it helpful to move and resize your windows so that {{< meta tool.name >}} and the live preview are side by side.

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_jupyterlab"}
ADD SCREENSHOT of Jupyterlab with Terminal open, side by side with preview.
:::

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_rstudio"}
ADD SCREENSHOT RStudio with Terminal open, side by side with preview.
:::

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_vscode"}
ADD SCREENSHOT VSCODE with Terminal open, side by side with preview.
:::


The contents of the article is generated by `{{< meta article-file >}}`. Go ahead and open this file in {{< meta tool.name >}}. You'll dive into the details of this file next, but for now let's make a change and see what happens.

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_jupyterlab"}
The first cell (starting with "La Palma Earthquakes") is a Markdown cell, enter Edit mode in this cell, and find the line:
:::

::: {.content-visible unless-meta="tool.is_jupyterlab"}
Find the line:
:::

``` yaml
title: La Palma Earthquakes
```

Change the line to:

``` yaml
title: La Palma Earthquake Mechanisms
```

Save the notebook, and you'll see the preview update automatically.

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_jupyterlab"}
ADD SCREENSHOT that shows side by side: Jupyterlab with first cell in Edit mode and change made; and updated preview

::: callout-tip
If you close the preview accidentally, you can navigate to it again by using the URL from the output in the Terminal, e.g. `http://localhost:3806/`. If you want to stop the preview, hit Crtl + C in the Terminal. You can start the preview again by running `quarto preview`.
