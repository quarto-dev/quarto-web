### Clone the Template Repository {#clone-repo}

To follow this tutorial you'll need your own copy of the [template repository](%7B%7B%3C%20meta%20template-repo%20%3E%7D%7D).

1.  Head to [GitHub to create a new repository from the template](%7B%7B%3C%20meta%20template-repo%20%3E%7D%7D/generate).

    Provide a "Repository Name" and make sure you check the box "Include all branches". Then "Create repository from template". ![](images/github-create-from-template.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of GitHub's create a new repo from a template page. Repository name has been filled with manuscript-template, and the box labelled Include all branches is checked."}

2.  Once your repository is created, clone it to your local computer.

    For instance in the Terminal, it might look like:

    ``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
    git clone https://github.com/cwickham/manuscript-tutorial.git
    ```

    Where you use your own user name and repo name.

    You can do this any way you are comfortable, but one approach is to use File -\> New Project

    EXPLAIN USING RStudio File -\> New Project INSTEAD

    ADD SCREENSHOT of RStudio open with files pane open showing directory structure.

3.  You'll be working inside this directory throughout the tutorial, so if you are ready to proceed, navigate inside the directory, and start Jupyter Lab:

    ``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
    cd manuscript-tutorial
    python3 -m jupyter lab
    ```

    ADD SCREENSHOT of Jupyterlab open with files pane open showing directory structure.\
