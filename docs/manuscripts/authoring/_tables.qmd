Tables can be added inline with what is known as pipe syntax. As an example, in the {{< meta article-file >}} a table of earthquakes is specified as:

```markdown
| Name                 | Year   |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| Current              | 2021   |
| Teneguía             | 1971   |
| Nambroque            | 1949   |
| El Charco            | 1712   |
| Volcán San Antonio   | 1677   |
| Volcán San Martin    | 1646   |
| Tajuya near El Paso  | 1585   |
| Montaña Quemada      | 1492   |

: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}
```

Columns are separated by pipes (`|`), and the dashes (`-`) in the second row separate the header row from the rest of the table. A caption can be provided with a line starting with `:`. A label that can be used for cross references is added at the end of the caption inside curly braces. Like figures, the label prefix `tbl-` is required for cross references, but the suffix is up to you.

You can learn more about tables in Quarto, including an alternative syntax known as grid tables, on the [Tables](/docs/authoring/tables.html) page in the Quarto documentation.

You can also include tables directly from inline computations, see [Inline Computations](#inline-computations) below for more details.
