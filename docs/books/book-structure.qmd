## Overview

The structure of a Quarto book can be as simple as a list of chapters, or can alternatively incorporate multiple parts and/or appendices. Quarto book chapters and sections are automatically numbered (for cross-referencing), however you can also specify that some parts of the book should remain unnumbered.

The simple book configuration generated by `quarto create project book` illustrates the basics. 
Book properties like the title, author and chapter structure are listed under `book`:

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
book:
  title: "mybook"
  author: "Jane Doe"
  date: "5/9/2021"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - intro.qmd
    - summary.qmd
    - references.qmd
```

-   The `index.qmd` file is required (because Quarto books also produce a website in HTML format). This page should include the preface, acknowledgements, etc. The HTML version of the book will use the `index.qmd` as the home page and if provided, will place the `cover-image` on that page.
-   The remainder of `chapters` includes one or more book chapters.
-   The `references.qmd` file will include the generated bibliography (see [References] below for details).

Rendering options that should apply to all chapters and all formats are listed at the top-level of `_quarto.yml`(i.e. not nested under `book`):

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
bibliography: references.bib
```

Rendering options that should apply to all chapters for specific formats are listed under `format`:

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrreprt
```

## Titles

Since rendering options are provided in `_quarto.yml`, you'll typically see a simple level-one heading at the top of chapters. For example:

``` {.markdown filename="intro.qmd"}
# Introduction
```

Note that the following is also still perfectly valid:

```{.yaml filename="intro.qmd"}
---
title: "Introduction"
---
```

In the absence of a level-one heading or a title set in the YAML front matter, the first heading in the page will be used as the title.

## Chapter Numbers

All chapters are numbered by default. If you want a chapter to be unnumbered simply add the `.unnumbered` class to its main heading. For example, it is common to omit the chapter number for `index.qmd`:

```{.markdown filename="index.qmd"}
# Preface {.unnumbered}
```

You can mix together numbered and unnumbered chapters. Note however that while you can link to unnumbered chapters, you can't [cross reference](/docs/authoring/cross-references.qmd) figures, tables, etc. within them. Unnumbered chapters are therefore mostly useful for prefatory content or references at the end of your book.

## Section Numbers

You can set the numbering depth via the `number-depth` option. For example, to only number sections immediately below the chapter level, use this:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
number-depth: 1
```

Note that `number-depth` is a format option, not a `book` option so it is placed at the top-level of `_quarto.yml`, not nested under `book`. 
If you want `number-depth` to only apply to a certain format, nest it under `format`:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
format:
  pdf:
    number-depth: 1
```

The `toc-depth` option is independent of `number-depth` (i.e. you can have unnumbered entries in the TOC if they are masked out from numbering by `number-depth`).

## References

You should include a `div` with the id `#refs` at the location in your book where you'd like the bibliography to be generated. For example the `references.qmd` file generated by `quarto create project book` includes this:

```{.markdown filename="references.qmd"}
# References {.unnumbered}

::: {#refs}
:::
```

Note that you can change the chapter title to whatever you like, remove `.unnumbered` to have it be numbered like other chapters, and add other content before or after the bibliography as necessary.

## Creating an Index

For PDF output, you can create an index using the LaTeX [makeidx](https://ctan.org/pkg/makeidx?lang=en) package along with the `\index` command.

To add an index to the PDF output for a book, add these `include-in-header` and `include-after-body` entries to your `pdf` format configuration in `_quarto.yml`:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrreprt
    include-in-header: 
      text: |
        \usepackage{makeidx}
        \makeindex
    include-after-body: 
      text: |
        \printindex
```

Then, add `\index{entry}` commands wherever you want an index entry. For example:

```{.latex filename="chapter.qmd"}
Markdown\index{Markdown} allows you to write using
an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format.
```

Alternatively, you can also use the [imakeidx](https://ctan.org/pkg/imakeidx) package.
This packages offers additional features for formatting the index. For example:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrreprt
    include-in-header: 
      text: |
        \usepackage{imakeidx}
        \makeindex[intoc=true, columns=3, columnseprule=true, options=-s latex/indexstyles.ist]
    include-after-body: 
      text: |
        \printindex
```

In the above example, `intoc=true` will include an entry for the index into the table of contents,
`columns=3` will format the index into three columns, and `columnseprule=true` will display a line between index columns.
Finally, `options=-s latex/indexstyles.ist` will use additional formatting options from an index-style file located at `latex/indexstyles.ist`.
Many other features are available in the [imakeidx](https://ctan.org/pkg/imakeidx) package. Please refer to its documentation for further details.

Note that `\index` commands are automatically ignored for non-PDF output.

## Parts & Appendices

:::{.callout-note}

## Please Note

Note that EPUB and Word (Docx) formats do not currently support organizing books into parts. When rendering a book with parts to these formats, the parts will be ignored. HTML, PDF, and Typst formats fully support parts and appendices.

:::

You can divide your book into parts using `part` within the book `chapters`. For example:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
book:
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - preface.qmd
    - part: dice.qmd
      chapters: 
        - basics.qmd
        - packages.qmd
    - part: cards.qmd
      chapters:
        - objects.qmd
        - notation.qmd
        - modifying.qmd
        - environments.qmd
```

Note that the markdown files `dice.qmd` and `cards.qmd` contain the part title (as a level one heading) as well as some introductory content for the part. If you just need a part title then you can alternatively use this syntax:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
book:
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - preface.qmd
    - part: "Dice"
      chapters: 
        - basics.qmd
        - packages.qmd
```

You can include appendices by adding an `appendices` key to your `book` config. For example:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
book:
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - intro.qmd
    - summary.qmd
    - references.qmd
  appendices:
    - tools.qmd
    - resources.qmd
  
```

Parts and appendices show up like this in HTML output:

![](images/book-parts-appendices.png){.border fig-alt="A screenshot of the welcome page of a book rendered with Quarto. In the sidebar, content is separated by three different bold section titles. From top to bottom, these are: 'PROJECT 1: WEIGHTED DICE', 'PROJECT 2: PLAYING CARDS', and 'APPENDICES.'"}

In LaTeX output, the `\part` command is used for parts. In EPUB and MS Word output parts are ignored entirely.

Appendices are numbered using uppercase alpha, and have a prefix inserted into their title to indicate they are an appendix (e.g. "Appendix A --- Additional Resources"). You can customize the prefix and delimiter using the following options:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
crossref:
  appendix-title: "App."
  appendix-delim: ":"
```

Which would result in the above example being output as: "App. A: Additional Resources". 
Note that `crossref` is a format option and is not nested under `book`.

{{< include ../websites/_page-navigation.md >}} 

{{< include ../websites/_footer.md >}}
