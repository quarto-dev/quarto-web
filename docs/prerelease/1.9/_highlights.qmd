Quarto 1.9 includes the following new features:

- [Privacy-first cookie consent](/docs/websites/website-tools.qmd#cookie-consent): The default for cookie consent has changed to `type: express`, providing opt-in consent that blocks cookies until users explicitly agree. This privacy-conscious default is designed with modern privacy regulations in mind.

- [`aria-label` for videos](/docs/authoring/videos.qmd#accessibility-label): Improve accessibility of embedded videos by providing custom descriptive labels for screen readers instead of the default "Video Player" label.

- [Alt text for equations in Typst](/docs/output-formats/typst.qmd#equation-alt-text): Improve accessibility of cross-referenced equations by providing descriptive text for screen readers using the `alt` attribute.

- [`quarto use brand` command](/docs/authoring/brand.qmd#quarto-use-brand): Add or update brand assets from an external source.

- Metadata and brand extensions now work without a `_quarto.yml` project. A temporary default project is created in memory.

- [Engine extensions](/docs/extensions/engine.qmd) allow replacement of the execution engine:
  - Julia is now a bundled extension instead of being built-in.
  - **quarto-marimo** will soon change from a filter extension to an engine extension.
  - New `quarto create extension engine` command.
  - New `quarto call build-ts-extension` command.
  - New **Quarto API** for engine extensions to use. (This is in flux and will not be documented for the next few releases, but there will be a dev blog post about it.)
