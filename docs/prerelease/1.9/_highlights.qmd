Quarto 1.9 includes the following new features:

- [Posit Connect Cloud Publishing](/docs/publishing/posit-connect-cloud.qmd): Publish documents and websites to Posit Connect Cloud using `quarto publish posit-connect-cloud`.

- [Output for LLMs](/docs/websites/website-llms.qmd): Generate `llms.txt` and `.llms.md` files for websites, making your content more accessible to large language models and AI-powered tools.

- [`quarto use brand` command](/docs/authoring/brand.qmd#quarto-use-brand): Add or update brand assets from an external source.

- [List Tables](/docs/authoring/tables.qmd#list-tables): Create complex tables with a list-like syntax. An easier-to-maintain alternative to grid tables, originally developed by Martin Fischer with contributions from Albert Krewinkel and William Lupton.

- PDF Accessibility:

  - PDF Standards and Accessibility for [LaTeX](/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.qmd#pdf-accessibility-standards) and [Typst](/docs/output-formats/typst.qmd#pdf-accessibility-standards): New `pdf-standard` option enables PDF/A archival formats and PDF/UA accessibility compliance. Use `quarto install verapdf` to automatically validate compliance.

  - [Image alt text for PDF accessibility](/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.qmd#pdf-standard): Alt text `fig-alt` attributes now passes through to PDF output for screen reader support in both LaTeX and Typst formats.

  - [Alt text for cross-referenced equations in Typst](/docs/output-formats/typst.qmd#equation-alt-text): Provide descriptive text for equations using the `alt` attribute.

- Improvements to Typst support:
  
  - [Typst book projects](/docs/books/book-output.qmd#typst-output): Book projects can now render to Typst via the bundled `orange-book` extension, providing chapter numbering, cross-references, and professional textbook styling.

  - Support for [Article layout](/docs/authoring/article-layout.qmd): Place content in the margins, create full-width figures, or add side notes. 

  - New options:
    - `mathfont`, `codefont`, `linestretch`
    - `linkcolor`, `citecolor`, `filecolor` 
    - `thanks`
    - `abstract-title` 

  - [Theorem styling](/docs/output-formats/typst.qmd#theorems): New `theorem-appearance` option with four styles: `simple` (classic LaTeX), `fancy` (colored boxes with brand colors), `clouds` (rounded backgrounds), or `rainbow` (colored borders and titles).

- Privacy-focused features for websites:

  - [A privacy-first default for cookie consent](/docs/websites/website-tools.qmd#cookie-consent): The default for cookie consent has changed to `type: express`, providing opt-in consent that blocks cookies until users explicitly agree. This privacy-conscious default is designed with modern privacy regulations in mind.

  - [Algolia Search Insights avoids cookies](/docs/websites/website-search.qmd#cookie-consent-and-user-tracking): Use Algolia Insights now uses persistent cookies only if `cookie-consent` is active, and the user has opted-in.

  - [Use Plausible Analytics](/docs/websites/website-tools.qmd#plausible-analytics): Add privacy-friendly Plausible Analytics to websites via the `plausible-analytics` configuration option.

- [`aria-label` for videos](/docs/authoring/videos.qmd#accessibility-label): Improve accessibility of embedded videos by providing custom descriptive labels for screen readers instead of the default "Video Player" label.

- [New `syntax-highlighting` Option](/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.qmd#syntax-highlighting): Replaces the deprecated `highlight-style` (Pandoc 3.8). Supports style names, custom `.theme` files, `none`, or `idiomatic` for format-native highlighting.

- Metadata and brand extensions now work without a `_quarto.yml` project. A temporary default project is created in memory.

- [Engine extensions](/docs/extensions/engine.qmd) allow replacement of the execution engine:
  - Julia is now a bundled extension instead of being built-in.
  - **quarto-marimo** will soon change from a filter extension to an engine extension.
  - New `quarto create extension engine` command.
  - New `quarto call build-ts-extension` command.
  - New **Quarto API** for engine extensions to use. (This is in flux and will not be documented for the next few releases, but there will be a dev blog post about it.)
