Quarto 1.9 includes the following new features:

- [Privacy-first cookie consent](/docs/websites/website-tools.qmd#cookie-consent): The default for cookie consent has changed to `type: express`, providing opt-in consent that blocks cookies until users explicitly agree. This privacy-conscious default is designed with modern privacy regulations in mind.

- [`aria-label` for videos](/docs/authoring/videos.qmd#accessibility-label): Improve accessibility of embedded videos by providing custom descriptive labels for screen readers instead of the default "Video Player" label.
