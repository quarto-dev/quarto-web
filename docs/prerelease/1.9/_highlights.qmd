Quarto 1.9 includes the following new features:

- [List Tables](/docs/authoring/tables.qmd#list-tables): Built-in support for ReStructuredText-style list tables, an easier-to-maintain alternative to grid tables. Originally developed by Martin Fischer with contributions from Albert Krewinkel and William Lupton.

- [`aria-label` for videos](/docs/authoring/videos.qmd#accessibility-label): Improve accessibility of embedded videos by providing custom descriptive labels for screen readers instead of the default "Video Player" label.
