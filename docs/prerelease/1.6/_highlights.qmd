- Reveal JS updated to v5.1.0. Adds: 
  - [Jump To Slide](/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#jump-to-slide): a menu to quickly navigate between slides. 
  - [Scroll View](/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#scroll-view): a mode to view a presentation as a scrollable page.

- [`{{{< contents >}}}` shortcode](/docs/authoring/contents.qmd): Flexibly rearrange the contents of your document, including moving the results of an executable code cell.

- [Landscape mode](/docs/authoring/article-layout.qmd#landscape-mode) blocks: Use fenced divs with class `.landscape` to set portions of `docx`, `pdf` and `typst` documents to landscape. Thanks to [`@edvinsyk`](https://github.com/edvinsyk)!
