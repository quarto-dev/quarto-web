## Introduction

The [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/py/) package provides an easy way to build web applications with Python. Quarto documents can also now include embedded Shiny components (e.g. a plot with sliders that control its inputs) or even simple Shiny applications that include several components.

This section covers integrating Shiny with Quarto and assumes that you already have basic familiarity with Shiny. To learn more about Shiny please visit <https://shiny.posit.co/py/>.

{{< include _shiny-requirements.qmd >}}

## Hello, Shiny

Here's a simple example that illustrates embedding Shiny components within a Quarto document:

![](images/hello.png){.border}

Here's the source code for this example (click the numbered annotations on the right for additional explanation):

````{.python}
---
title: "Penguin Flipper Length"
format: html
server: shiny  # <1>
---

```{{python}}
import seaborn as sns
from shiny import render, reactive, ui
penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins")
```

```{{python}}
#| panel: input  # <2>
ui.input_slider("bins", "Number of bins:", 5, 15, 10)
```

```{{python}}
@render.plot  # <3>
def histogram(): # <3>
    sns.histplot(data = penguins, x ="flipper_length_mm", # <3>
                 bins=input.bins()) # <3>
```
````

1. The main difference between this document and a normal static document is the inclusion of `server: shiny` within the document's options, which instructs Quarto to run a Shiny process behind the document:


2. We use the `panel: input` cell option to provide visual separation for inputs. The plot rendering code in the next cell uses normal Shiny reactive output syntax.

3. To render reactive content within Shiny documents you implement a function that returns the content and annotate it with a render decorator (in this case `@render.plot`).

If you want to try running this example now, paste the `hello.qmd` code from above into a Quarto document within VS Code and execute the **Preview** command:

![](images/hello-vscode.png){.border}

Note that while there are some integrated tools available within VS Code, you can use any editor you like for developing Shiny interactive documents. See the [Running Documents](running.qmd) for details on running from the command line, debugging, deployment, etc.

## Sidebar Layout

Here's an example that includes multiple inputs as well as a more application-like page layout with a sidebar:

![](images/custom.png){.border}

Here's the source code for this example:

````python
---
title: "Penguin Bills"
format: html
page-layout: full  # <1>
server: shiny
---

```{{python}}
import seaborn as sns
from shiny import render, reactive, ui
penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins")
```

```{{python}}
#| panel: sidebar  # <2>
ui.input_select("x", "Variable:", 
                choices=["bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm"])
ui.input_select("dist", "Distribution:", choices=["hist", "kde"])
ui.input_checkbox("rug", "Show rug marks", value = False)
```

```{{python}}
#| panel: fill  # <3>
@render.plot
def displot():
    sns.displot(
        data=penguins, hue="species", multiple="stack",
        x=input.x(), rug=input.rug(),kind=input.dist())
```
````

1.  The YAML front-matter includes the `page-layout: full` option (to indicate we want our content to occupy the entire page rather than being centered with padding).

2.  We use `panel: sidebar` to group inputs in a sidebar to the left of the content display.

3. We use `panel: fill` to ensure that the content occupies all of the page to the right of the sidebar.


## In Depth Example

Below is a more in-depth example that demonstrates additional concepts including factoring out setup code, reactive calculations, and more advanced layout constructs. Here is the interactive document we'll be building:

![](images/advanced.png){.border}

The code for this document is below. Click on the numbered annotations on the right for additional explanation of the techniques used.

````python
---
title: "Palmer Penguins"
format: html
page-layout: full
server: shiny
---

Explore the Palmer Penguins dataset (learn more about the data at <https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/>).

```{{python}} # <1>
#| context: setup   # <1>
import seaborn as sns # <1>
from shiny import render, reactive, ui # <1>
penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins") # <1>
``` # <1>

::: {.panel-sidebar}  # <2>

### Penguins ![](images/penguins.png){width=50px}

```{{python}}
species = list(penguins["species"].value_counts().index) # <3>
ui.input_checkbox_group(  # <3>
    "species", "Species:", # <3>
    species, selected = species # <3>
)

islands = list(penguins["island"].value_counts().index) # <3>
ui.input_checkbox_group(  # <3>
    "islands", "Islands:",  # <3>
    islands, selected = islands # <3>
) #<3>

@reactive.Calc   # <4>
def filtered_penguins(): # <4>
    data = penguins[penguins["species"].isin(input.species())] # <4>
    data = data[data["island"].isin(input.islands())] # <4>
    return data # <4>
``` #<4>

***

```{{python}}  # <5>
ui.input_select("dist", "Distribution:", choices=["kde", "hist"]) # <5>
ui.input_checkbox("rug", "Show rug marks", value = False) # <5>
``` #<5>  

:::

::: {.panel-tabset}  # <6>

### Plots

```{{python}}
@render.plot # <7>
def depth(): # <7>
    return sns.displot( # <7>
        filtered_penguins(), x = "bill_depth_mm", # <7>
        hue = "species", kind = input.dist(), # <7>
        legend = False, fill = True, rug=input.rug() # <7>
    ) # <7>

@render.plot
def length():
    return sns.displot(
        filtered_penguins(), x = "bill_length_mm", 
        hue = "species", kind = input.dist(), 
        legend=False, fill = True, rug=input.rug()
    )
```

### Data

```{{python}}  # <8>
@render.data_frame # <8>
def dataview(): # <8>
    return render.DataGrid(filtered_penguins(), height = "775px") # <8>
``` #<8>
:::
````

1. The `context: setup` cell option indicates that this code cell should run when the application starts (as opposed to when each new client session starts). Expensive initialization code (e.g. loading data) should be placed in `context: setup`.

2. You can define sidebars using a `.panel-sidebar` div. This enables you to include arbitray content in the sidebar including images, narrative, and links.

3. These checkbox input groups have their contents dynamically driven from the available categories in the `species` and `islands` fields of the dataset.

4. When the user interacts with the checkbox groups this results in a different filtered view of the dataset. The `@reactive.Calc` function recomputes the filtered dataset and makes it available as `filtered_penguins()`.

5. These inputs affect the display of plots but not the contents of the filtered dataset.

6. You can define a tabset using a `.panel-tabset` div (individual tabs are in turn defined using headings, in this case `### Plots` and `### Data`).

7. Plots are rendered by referencing the filtered dataset (`filtered_penguins()` as well as the plot display oriented inputs (`input.dist()` and `input.rug()`). Plots are automatically re-rendered when the dataset or these inputs change.

8. The Data tab also references `filtered_penguins()` and is updated whenever the filtered data changes.
