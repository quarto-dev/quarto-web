## Changes in HTML output

The changes to cross-references in Quarto 1.4 also introduce some changes to the underlying HTML output of figures and other cross-referenceable elements. For most users, these changes will be invisible. However, if you are operating on Quarto HTML output, you may be impacted. In particular:

- The DOM structure for HTML figures used to be such that the following CSS selector would work:
  
  ```
  div#fig-elephant > figure > figcaption.figure-caption
  ```
  
  In Quarto v1.4, this is now
  
  ```
  div#fig-elephant > figure.quarto-float.quarto-float-fig > figcaption.quarto-float-caption.quarto-float-fig
  ```

  Here's a minimal, full HTML output for a figure:

  ```html
  <div id="fig-1" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center anchored">
    <figure class="quarto-float quarto-float-fig figure">
    <div aria-describedby="fig-1-caption-0ceaefa1-69ba-4598-a22c-09a6ac19f8ca">
      <img src="./img/content.jpg">
    </div>
    <figcaption id="fig-1-caption-0ceaefa1-69ba-4598-a22c-09a6ac19f8ca" class="quarto-float-caption quarto-float-fig">
    Figure&nbsp;1: This is a caption.
    </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  ```

  Concretely: 

  - All cross-referenceable elements use the `figure` HTML element with class `quarto-float`.
  - Different float types are differentiated by the CSS class `quarto-float-fig` (or `-tbl`, `-lst`, or the `ref_type` of custom cross-reference types) as well as the additional CSS class `figure`, `table`, etc. 
    If the element is a subfloat, this will be `quarto-subfloat-fig`.
  - Similarly, float captions use the `figcaption` element with class `quarto-float-caption` (or `quarto-subfloat-caption` if they're a subfloat), and also have the `quarto-float-*` CSS classes.
  
  This setup lets all "floats" be uniformly targeted by a single CSS rule, as well as allowing specific float types and their captions be targeted by a single additional CSS selector.

- Images by themselves used to have a surrounding paragraph; they no longer do.

- Floats include an extra div for ARIA referencing, so that captions are referenced appropriately and uniformly. 
  As a result, if a table appears inside a float, its caption will be hoisted to the figure node itself.
