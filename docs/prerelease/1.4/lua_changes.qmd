Quarto v1.4 includes the following new features for Lua filters:

## Support for crossreferenceable elements in filters

Quarto v1.4 brings significant changes to the handling of figures, tables, listings, etc.
These changes simplify the writing of Lua filters that targets those elements, but will 
generally require changes in existing.

### The `FloatRefTarget` AST node

In v1.4, crossreferenceable elements all have a single generic type, `FloatRefTarget`. 
This element can be constructed explicitly in a Lua filter.
It can also be used as the element to be processed in a Lua filter directly.

```{.lua}
-- A filter targeting FloatRefTarget nodes
return {
  FloatRefTarget = function(float)
    if float.caption_long then
      float.caption_long.content:insert(pandoc.Str("[This will appear at the beginning of every caption]"))
      return float
    end
  end
}
```

`FloatRefTarget` nodes have the following fields:

- `type`: The type of element: `Figure`, `Table`, `Listing`, etc. Quarto v1.4 supports
  custom node types that can be declared at the document or project level.
- `content`: The content of the Figure, Table, etc. Quarto v1.4
  accepts any content in any `FloatRefTarget` type (so if your tables are better displayed
  as an image, you can use that.).
- `caption_long`: The caption that appears in the main body of the document
- `caption_short`: The caption that appears in the element collations (such as a list of tables, 
  list of figures, etc.)
- `identifier`, `attributes`, `classes`: these are analogous to `Attr` fields in Pandoc AST elements like spans and divs. 
  `identifier`, in addition, needs to be the string that is used in a crossref (`fig-cars`, `tbl-votes`, `lst-query`, and so on).
- `parent_id`: if a `FloatRefTarget` is a subfloat of a parent multiple-element float, then `parent_id` will hold the identifier
  of the parent float.

## Custom formats and Custom renderers

Quarto v1.4 adds support for extensible renderers of quarto AST nodes such as `FloatRefTarget`, `Callout`.
In order to declare a custom renderer, add the following to a Lua filter:

```lua
local predicate = function(float)
  -- return true if this renderer should be used;
  -- typically, this will return true if the custom format is active.
end
local renderer = function(float)
  -- returns a plain Pandoc representation of the rendered figure.
end
quarto._quarto.ast.add_renderer(
  "FloatRefTarget", 
  predicate, 
  renderer)
```

## Relative paths in `require()` calls

In larger, more complex filters, it becomes useful to structure your Lua code in modules.
Quarto v1.4 supports the use of relative paths in `require()` calls so that small modules
can be easily created and reused.

For example:

```{.lua filename="filter.lua"}
local utility = require('./utils')
function Pandoc(doc)
  -- process 
end
```

Using relative paths this way in quarto makes it harder for multiple filters to accidentally
create conflicting module names (as would eventually happen when using the standard Lua
`require('utils')` syntax). It's possible to refer to subdirectories and parent directories as well:

```{.lua filename="filter2.lua"}
local parsing = require('./utils/parsing')
function Pandoc(doc)
  -- process 
end
```

```{.lua filename="utils/parsing.lua"}
local utils = require("../utils")
-- ...
```

## More precise targeting of AST processing phases

Before Quarto 1.4, Lua filters are either "pre" filters (the default setting), or "post" filters.
Those filters are specified like this:

```yaml
# "pre" filters:
filters:
  - pre_filter_1.lua
  - pre_filter_2.lua  
  # ...
# "post" filters:
filters:
  - quarto
  - post_filter_1.lua
  - post_filter_2.lua  
  # ...
```

This syntax continues to work in 1.4. 
In addition, it is now possible to specify more precisely the place where a specific filter will be inserted. 
Quarto's AST processing phase is now split into three parts: `ast`, `quarto`, and `render`.

- `ast`: normalizes the input syntax from Pandoc, recognizing constructs such as `Callout`, `FloatRefTarget`, and so on.
- `quarto`: processes the normalized syntax, for example by resolving cross-references.
- `render`: produces format-specific output from the processed input.

In Quarto 1.4, Lua filters can be inserted before or after any of these stages:

```yaml
filters:
  - at: before-ast
    path: filter1.lua
  - at: after-quarto
    path: filter2.lua
  - at: after-render
    path: filter3.lua
```

Any of the stages can be prefixed by `before-` or `after`.
In Quarto 1.4, `before-quarto` and `after-ast` correspond to the same insertion location in the filter chain, as do `after-quarto` and `before-render`.
Quarto 1.3's "pre" filters correspond to `before-quarto`, and "post" filters correspond to `after-render`. `before-ast` and `before-render` are new insertion locations.
We will consider adding more insertion locations, should the need arise.
