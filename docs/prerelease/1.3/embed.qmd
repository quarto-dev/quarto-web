## Overview

Quarto 1.3 supports embedding the output of external notebooks within Quarto documents using the `embed` shortcode and providing a path to a Jupyter Notebook and a cell identifier. For example, using the notebook:

![](images/notebook-simple.png)

You could embed the first code cell using the following shortcode:

``` markdown
{{< embed plots.ipynb#plot-dot >}}
```

The result of rendered a page with that embed is:

{{< embed plots.ipynb#plot-dot >}}

## Specifying Cells

The embed specifies the notebook using an input relative path (`plots.ipynb`) followed by an optional cell identifier following a hash character `#plot-dot.` (If the cell identifier is omitted, all cells will be embedded in the document in place of the shortcode).

The cell identifier in an embed will be used to locate the proper cell using the following cell locations:

1.  **Cell `id`**First, the cell metadata will be checked for a matching `id` , if found, this cell will be embedded.
2.  **Label\
    **If no cell with an `id` is found, Quarto will use a cell that has a `label` in the code metadata which matches the embed's id.
3.  **Tags\
    **If no cell has been found, Quarto will use a cell or cell(s) which has a tag which matches the embed's id.

## Embedding Code

In addition to embedding the output of a code cell, you may include the code from the cell by using the `echo=true` option. For example, the same embed with the echo option produces:

{{< embed plots.ipynb#plot-dot echo=true >}}

::: callout-note
Code custom customization options for the document in which these cells are embedded will also control these code cells. (For example, `code-fold: true`{spellcheck="false"} will fold the cells by default).

## Code Cell Options

Content and code that is being embedded from Jupyter notebooks can also code cell options like `fig-cap`, `layout-ncol`, and so on to include additional options from the Notebook. So embedding the cell labeled `fig-fruit`, which includes the following code:

``` python
#| label: fig-fruit
#| fig-cap: Charts
#| fig-subcap: 
#|   - A distribution of the fruit that I eat each week
#|   - Another pie chart which shows a distribution of something
#| layout-ncol: 2

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x=[4,9,16,25,36]
fig = plt.figure(figsize =(5.5, 5.5))
plt.pie(x, labels=("Guavas", "Berries","Mangoes","Apples", "Avocado"),
colors = ( "#a86544", "#eb5b13", "#ebc713", "#bdeb13", "#8aeb13"))
plt.show()

x2=[4,9,16,25,36]
fig2 = plt.figure(figsize =(9, 5)) # line 4
plt.pie(x2)
plt.show()
```

using a simple embed:

`{{{< embed plots.ipynb#fig-fruit >}}}`

results in the following output:

{{< embed plots.ipynb#fig-fruit >}}

## Source Notebook Links

When you embed the contents of Notebooks in a Quarto document and render the document to HTML, Quarto will automatically include links to the source Notebooks that provided the embedded content. These links will by default appear both inline below the embedded content as well as below the TOC. For example, the following document embeds content from the notebook `plots.ipynb`. You can see the links in the rendered HTML document below:

### Link Placement

You can control the placement of the links to source notebook by specifying the option `notebook-links`{spellcheck="false"} with one of the following values:

`false`{spellcheck="false"}

:   Do not display any links to source notebooks.

`inline`{spellcheck="false"}

:   Display only the inline links to source notebooks (which appear below the embedded content). Do not display links to the source document alongside the TOC.

`global`{spellcheck="false"}

:   Display only links to source notebooks alongside the TOC. Do not display links inline below the embedded content.

## Source Notebook Views

By default, Quarto will automatically generate an HTML rendering of the notebook which displays the contents of the notebook and includes a button to download the notebook. This makes it easier for users to view the Notebook contents without needing to download and run the Notebook locally. As an example, you can view the preview for the \`plots.ipynb\` notebook used in this document:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
[View Notebook Preview](/docs/prerelease/plots.ipynb.html){.btn .btn-primary}
:::

The notebook preview is generated using Quarto to render the notebook itself. This means that the preview can be generated for any standard Jupyter Notebook- the Notebook will not be executed - but the Jupyter Notebook can also include Quarto directives (e.g. front matter) and markdown, which will be respected (for example, it could reference a bibliography and use citations).

You can control the behavior of notebook views using `notebook-view`. For each source notebook, you can provide a `title` and a `url`. The `title` will be used as the text of the any links to the source notebook and will also appear at the top of the rendered notebook view. The `url`, if provided, will be used as the `href` of any links to the source notebook. This is useful if you have deployed a copy of the source notebook to a site like Github, Google Colab, or Kaggle and would rather link to that instead.

For example:

``` {.markdown style="whitespace: pre-wrap;"}
notebook-view:
  - notebook: plots.ipynb
    title: "Plots and Computations"
    url: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12GsIPQ644SI4vkEEHiZn-Qqfbr-bD1__
```

will result in links to the source notebook like so:

To disable the notebook views, and instead link directly to the Jupyter notebook (so the user may download the notebook with no intermediary view), set `notebook-view` to `false`.
