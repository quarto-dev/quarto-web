## Overview

Starting in Quarto v1.3, you can control the width of the layout components in HTML documents. For example, for a website that makes use of the margin for figures, it might make sense to give more space to the margin and less to the body: 

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![Default Layout](images/grid-default.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of a Quarto website displaying the default layout of the sidebar, body and margin."}

![Wider Margin](images/grid-custom.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of a Quarto website with altered layout, devoting more space to the margin and less to the body than the default layout."}
:::

This change can be made by adding the `grid` option to the `_quarto.yml` file, increasing the `margin-width` and decreasing the `body-width` from their defaults:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    grid:
      margin-width: 450px
      body-width: 600px
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Websites vs. Standalone HTML Pages. 

Customizing the layout of pages that are part of a Quarto website with YAML should happen at the site level in `_quarto.yml`. For HTML documents that aren't part of a website, these options could also be set in the YAML at the top of the document.

:::

There are four variables to control the four components of the layout: the sidebar, the body, the margin and the gutters. 

The rest of this page describes these components, and their default values, as well as how to customize them either with YAML or SCSS  variables.

## HTML Page Layout

Quarto HTML documents are arranged in a structure composed of a sidebar on the left, the body of the document, the margin of the document on the right, and the space between these elements, known as gutters. This is illustrated below:

![](images/grid.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of a page in the Quarto documentation site, with rectangles drawn around the sidebar, body and margin, and arrows indicating the gutters between them."}

The width of these four components is controlled by four variables. These variables, along with their default values are:

::: {style="width: 60%; margin: auto;"}
| Element                             | Size  |
|-------------------------------------|-------|
| `sidebar-width`{spellcheck="false"} | 250px |
| `body-width`{spellcheck="false"}    | 800px |
| `margin-width`{spellcheck="false"}  | 250px |
| `gutter-width`{spellcheck="false"}  | 1.5em |

: Default values for the width of layout components
:::

The values of these variables don't directly specify the display width of the corresponding component, instead they specify a maximum base value. The maximum values are scaled to create minimum values, and together they are used to compute the size and position of each component across different layout types (fixed vs. floating), responsive sizes (large screen vs. mobile size), and page contents (margin vs. no margin content). 

## Customizing Component Widths

You can control the component width variables using YAML or SCSS variables. To set these options in YAML, you may use the `grid` option :

``` yml
format:
  html: 
    grid:
      sidebar-width: 300px
      body-width: 900px
      margin-width: 300px
      gutter-width: 1.5rem
```

Similarly, in a [custom theme `scss` file](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#theme-options), you may set variables like:

``` css
// The left hand sidebar
$grid-sidebar-width: 300px !default;

// The main body
$grid-body-width: 900px !default;

// The right hand margin bar
$grid-margin-width: 300px !default;

// The gutter that appears between the above columns
$grid-column-gutter-width: 1.5rem !default;
```

`sidebar-width`, `body-width`, and `margin-width` should be specified in pixels (`px`) as the values will be used when computing other sizes. Requiring pixel sizing is a limitation of our approach to the Quarto's layout, but also typically makes sense since the overall document width is usually tied to the browser size and responsive breakpoints rather than font size or other relative measures. 

`gutter-width` may be specified in pixels or other units such as `em` or `rem` which are responsive to the document font size.
