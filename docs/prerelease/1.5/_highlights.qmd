Quarto 1.5 includes the following new features:

-   [Typst CSS](/docs/output-formats/typst.qmd#typst-css)---Format tables with borders and colors, and the formatting will be transferred from HTML to Typst.

-   [Typst 0.11.0](/docs/authoring/tables.qmd#features-available-only-in-html-tables)---Typst tables have feature parity with other formats, with colspans, rowspans, and alignment of individual cells.

-   [Website Draft Mode](/docs/websites/website-drafts.qmd)---Improved support for workflows involving draft posts and pages:

    -   Adds the `drafts` option to the `website` key offering new ways to specify drafts: directly in `_quarto.yml`, and via metadata includes and profiles.

    -   Introduces the `draft-mode` option to the `website` key to control how drafts are rendered. Drafts can be `gone`, `unlinked` or `visible`.

    -   Adds a draft banner to draft pages that are rendered.

    -   Improves the linking behaviour of draft documents. Now, in addition to being excluded from search results, listings, and the sitemap, drafts will not appear in navigation, or be linked from in-text hyperlinks when `draft-mode` is `gone` or `unlinked`.

    -   Changes the behavior of `quarto preview` for drafts. Drafts will be `visible` in previews regardless of the `draft-mode` setting. In particular, this allows an easier way to preview the appearance of draft content in navigation and listings.

-   [Website Announcement Bar](/docs/websites/website-tools.qmd#announcement-bar)---Add an announcement bar to your website.

-   [Placeholder Image Shortcodes](/docs/authoring/placeholder.qmd)---Easily add placeholder images to your documents (`{{{< placeholder >}}}`).

-   [Lorem Ipsum Text Shortcodes](/docs/authoring/lipsum.qmd)---Easily add lorem ipsum text to your documents (`{{{< lipsum >}}}`).

-   [Native Julia Engine](/docs/computations/julia.qmd#using-the-julia-engine)---Execute Julia code in Quarto documents without requiring Jupyter.

-   [Project Pre Render Scripts](/docs/projects/scripts.qmd#pre-and-post-render)---Project metadata and the render list are now re-computed after any pre-render scripts have executed.

-   [Element-wide disabling of HTML table processing](/docs/authoring/tables.qmd#library-authors)---Declare the comment `<!--| quarto-html-table-processing: none -->` anywhere in an HTML RawBlock.
