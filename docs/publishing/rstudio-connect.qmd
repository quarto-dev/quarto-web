## Overview

[Posit Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) is a publishing platform for secure sharing of data products within an organization. Use Posit Connect when you want to publish content within an organization rather than on the public internet.

There are several ways to publish Quarto content to Posit Connect:

1.  Use the `quarto publish` command to publish static content rendered on your local machine.

2.  Use the [rsconnect-python](https://docs.rstudio.com/rsconnect-python/) Python package or [quarto](https://quarto-dev.github.io/quarto-r/) R package to publish code for rendering on an Posit Connect server (e.g. for a scheduled report).

3.  Use Connect's support for [Git backed content](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/git-backed/) to automatically re-publish content when code is checked in to a Git repository.

4.  Use a Continuous Integration (CI) service like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), or [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), to render and publish to Connect.

Each of these options is covered in detail below. If you are just getting started, we strongly recommend using the first approach (`quarto publish`). Then, as your needs evolve, you can consider other more sophisticated options.

## Publish Command

The `quarto publish` command is the easiest way to publish locally rendered content. From the directory where your project is located, execute the `quarto publish` command for Connect:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish connect
```

If you haven't previously published to Connect you'll be prompted to enter your server's URL:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
$ quarto publish connect
 ? Server URL: › 
```

You'll then need to provide a [Connect API Key](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/api-keys/):

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
$ quarto publish connect
 ? Server URL: › https://connect.example.com/
 ? API Key: › 
```

After authenticating, your content will be rendered and published, and then a browser will open to view its admin page on Connect.

A record of your previous publishes will be stored in a `_publish.yml` file within the project or document directory. This file stores the service, id, and URL of the published content. For example:

``` yaml
- source: project
  connect:
    - id: "3bb5f59f-524a-45a5-9508-77e29a1e8bf0"
      url: "https://connect.example.com/content/3bb5f59f-524a-45a5-9508-77e29a1e8bf0/"
```

Account information is not stored in this file, so it is suitable for checking in to version control and being shared by multiple publishers.

You can customize this behavior of `quarto publish` by providing the following command line options:

{{< include _cli-options.md >}}

To publish a document rather than a website or book, provide the path to the document:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish connect document.qmd
```

## Publishing with Code

In the preceding example, we rendered content locally and then published it to Connect. In some cases, however, you may want to publish your source code to Connect and then have it rendered on the server (for example, to create a scheduled report that is updated with new data automatically).

The tools for publishing code differ depending on whether you are using the Knitr (R) or Jupyter (Python) engine, so we'll cover them separately below. Note that Quarto must be installed on the Connect server before you attempt to publish with code (this is typically done by an administrator, see the [Quarto Installation](https://docs.rstudio.com/resources/install-quarto/) documentation for additional details).

### Knitr (R)

The [quarto](https://quarto-dev.github.io/quarto-r/) R package includes a set of publishing functions that you can use for publishing Quarto projects with R code to Posit Connect. For example, here we publish a document and a website:

``` r
library(quarto)

quarto_publish_doc(
  "document.qmd", 
  server = "rsc.example.com", 
  account = "njones",
  render = "server"
)

quarto_publish_site(
  server = "rsc.example.com", 
  account = "njones",
  render = "server"
)
```

The `render = "server"` argument is what specifies that you want code rather than just content published.

Note that once you've published for the first time you can update without providing the explicit arguments:

``` r
quarto_publish_site()
```

See the article on [Quarto Publishing from R](https://quarto-dev.github.io/quarto-r/articles/publishing.html) for additional details on using these functions.

#### RStudio IDE

If you are using the RStudio IDE, there is also support for push-button publishing to Posit Connect. Use the publish button <kbd>![](images/publish-button.png){width="23" height="20"}</kbd> from the source editor or viewer pane to publish a document or a website:

![](images/rstudio-publish.png){.border}

See the Connect documentation on [Publishing from the RStudio IDE](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/publishing/) for additional details.

### Jupyter (Python)

The [rsconnect-python](https://docs.rstudio.com/rsconnect-python/) Python package provides a command line interface (CLI) that you can use to publish Quarto documents and websites that use Jupyter to Posit Connect. To use the CLI:

1.  First, install the rsconnect-python package and configure an Posit Connect server for publishing: <https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/connecting-cli/>

2.  Then, use the `rsconnect deploy quarto` command from your project directory:

    ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
    rsconnect deploy quarto
    ```

See the complete documentation on [Publishing Quarto Content](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/publishing-cli-quarto/) for additional details on using the CLI for publishing to Connect.

#### Notebook Plugin

If you are using the classic Jupyter Notebook you can install the [rsconnect-jupyter](https://docs.rstudio.com/rsconnect-jupyter/) notebook plugin to enable push button publishing of Jupyter notebooks:

1.  First, follow the directions in the rsconnect-jupyter [User Guide](https://docs.rstudio.com/rsconnect-jupyter/) to install the plugin.

2.  Then, click the publish button <kbd>![](images/publish-button.png){width="23" height="20"}</kbd>from a notebook you wish to publish. You'll be prompted to configure a Connect server and then be presented with a publishing dialog:

    ![](images/rsconnect-jupyter-usage.png){.border}

See the article on [Publishing Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/publishing-notebook/) for complete documentation on using the plugin.

## Publishing from Git

Content may be deployed to Posit Connect directly from a remote Git repository. Content will automatically fetch from the associated remote Git repository and re-deploy. This allows for integration with Git-centric workflows and continuous deployment automation.

In order to deploy Git-backed content to Posit Connect you'll follow a two step process:

1.  Create and commit a manifest file (this includes information on the R or Python dependencies required to render your content)

2.  Link Posit Connect to the Git repository

Note that Quarto must be installed on the Connect server before you attempt to publish from Git (this is typically done by an administrator, see the [Quarto Installation](https://docs.rstudio.com/resources/install-quarto/) documentation for additional details).

### Creating a Manifest

Consult the Connect documentation on [Git Backed Content](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/git-backed/) for complete details on creating manifests and checking them in to your repository. To give you a general idea of how this works, here is some sample code that creates a manifest for Knitr and Jupyter projects:

``` r
# write a manifest for a Knitr project
install.packages("rsconnect") # if required
rsconnect::writeManifest()
```

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
# write a manifest for a Jupyter notebook
pip install rsconnect-python # if required
rsconnect write-manifest notebook MyNotebook.ipynb
```

See the documentation on [Git Backed Content](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/git-backed/) for complete details on creating manifests.

### Connecting a Repository

Connect users must have *at least* the `publisher` role in order to create new content from a Git repository.

On the **Content** page, there is a button near the top labeled **Publish**. Clicking on this button will expand a menu which contains an item called "Import from Git", which may be clicked to launch a new content wizard.

![](images/import-from-git.png)

You'll be prompted to provide your repository URL, branch to publish from, and target directory to publish from (e.g., the one containing your `manifest.json`).

See the documentation on [Git Backed Content](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/git-backed/) for complete details on connecting Git repositories to Connect.

## Continuous Integration

You can also deploy Quarto content using a Continuous Integration (CI) service like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), or [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). In most cases, this will entail scripting the `quarto publish` command, however in the case of GitHub Actions, you can take advantage of the standard Quarto [publish action](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/tree/main/publish).

When publishing to Connect from a CI service you'll need to consider whether you want to execute your Python or R code directly on the CI server or whether you want to take advantage of previously [frozen](.../projects/code-execution.html#freeze) execution results. We'll explore this possibility first and then proceed to the specifics of how to publish from CI.

### Freezing Computations

Depending on how complicated your run-time requirements (packages, database credentials, etc.) are, you might find it more convenient to restrict execution of Python and R code to local contexts that have the required software and credentials.

{{< include _freeze-basics.md >}}

If you'd rather have CI publishing execute all Python and R code contained in your project, you'll need to ensure that the requisite version of these tools (and any required packages) are installed on the CI server. How to do this is outside the scope of this article---to learn more about saving and restoring dependencies, see the article on [Virtual Environments](../projects/virtual-environments.qmd).

### Publish Command

You can publish Quarto content to Connect using any CI service by scripting the `quarto publish` command. To do this, you'll need to make sure that your Connect server address and credentials are available as environment variables on the CI server.

| Variable          | Description                                                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `CONNECT_SERVER`  | Address of Posit Connect server (e.g., `https://connect.example.com`).    |
| `CONNECT_API_KEY` | Posit Connect [API Key](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/api-keys/) |

You will furthermore need to specify the ID of the target content to update. This will most frequently be drawn from the `_publish.yml` file that is saved into your project directory during publishing. For example:

```{.yaml filename="_publish.yml"}
- source: project
  connect:
    - id: 4f2ffc46-24b0-4cc7-a854-c5eb671e0dd7
      url: 'https://connect.example.com/content/4f2ffc46-24b0-4cc7-a854-c5eb671e0dd7/'
```

Assuming that you have a `_publish.yml` like the above, you can publish to Connect from CI with the following commands:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
export CONNECT_SERVER=https://connect.example.com/
export CONNECT_API_KEY=7C0947A852D8
quarto publish connect
```

Alternatively, if you don't have a `_publish.yml` file, you can specify the ID on the command line as follows:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish connect --id 4f2ffc46-24b0-4cc7-a854-c5eb671e0dd7
```

### GitHub Actions

If your CI service is [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) then you can take advantage of Quarto's standard [publish action](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/tree/main/publish) to automate deploying to Connect.

#### Server Credentials

Before creating the publish action, you need to ensure that your repository has the credentials required for publishing to Connect. You can do this as follows:

1.  If you don't already have one, create an Posit Connect [API Key](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/api-keys/) from the requisite Connect server and then copy it to the clipboard.

2.  Add the Connect API Key to your repository's action **Secrets** (accessible within repository **Settings**). You will see a **New repository secret** button at the top right:

    ![](images/gh-new-repository-secret.png){.border}

    Click the button and add the API Key from step 1 as a secret named `CONNECT_API_KEY`:

    ![](images/gh-action-connect-secret.png){.border}

#### Publish Action

To setup your publish action, create a `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file in your repository. If you are [Freezing Computations] (i.e. not running Python or R code within your action), then the file would look something like this:

```{.yaml filename=".github/workflows/publish.yml"}
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: main

name: Quarto Publish

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 

      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2

      - name: Render and Publish 
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: connect
          CONNECT_SERVER: https://connect.example.com
          CONNECT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONNECT_API_KEY }}
```

Once you've pushed your updated repository (including the publish action and `_freeze` directory) to GitHub, your action will run with this and subsequent commits, automatically rendering and publishing to Connect.

#### Executing Code

If you prefer, you can also configure GitHub Actions to execute Python or R code as part of rendering. While this might reflexively seem like the best approach, consider the following requirements imposed when you execute code within a CI service like GitHub Actions:

{{< include _ci-execute-requirements.md >}}

##### Prerequisites

The best way to ensure that your code can be executed within a GitHub Action is to use a virtual environment like [venv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) or [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) with your project (below we'll provide example actions for each). If you aren't familiar with using these tools check out the article on using [Virtual Environments](../projects/virtual-environments.qmd) with Quarto to learn more.

Once you've decided to execute code within your GitHub Action you can remove the `freeze: auto` described above from your `_quarto.yml` configuration. Note that if you want to use `freeze` selectively for some documents or directories that is still possible (for a directory, create a `_metadata.yml` file in the directory and specify your freeze configuration there---this is what Quarto does by default for the `posts` folder of blog projects).

##### Example: Jupyter with venv

Here is a complete example of a GitHub Action that installs Python, Jupyter, and package dependencies from `requirements.txt`, then executes code and renders output to Connect:

```{.yaml filename=".github/workflows/publish.yml"}
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: main

name: Quarto Publish

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 

      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
        
      - name: Install Python and Dependencies
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
          cache: 'pip'
      - run: pip install jupyter
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      - name: Render and Publish 
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: connect
          CONNECT_SERVER: https://connect.example.com
          CONNECT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONNECT_API_KEY }}
```

##### Example: Knitr with renv

Here is a complete example of a GitHub Action that installs R and package dependencies from `renv.lock`, then executes code and renders output to Connect:

```{.yaml filename=".github/workflows/publish.yml"}
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: main

name: Quarto Publish

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 

      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
        
      - name: Install R
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          r-version: '4.2.0'
      
      - name: Install R Dependencies 
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2
        with:
          cache-version: 1
      
      - name: Render and Publish
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: connect
          CONNECT_SERVER: https://connect.example.com
          CONNECT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONNECT_API_KEY }}
```

#### Additional Options

It's possible to have a Quarto project in a larger GitHub repository, where the Quarto project does not reside at the top-level directory. In this case, add a `path` input to the invocation of the `publish` action. For example:

``` yaml
- name: Render and Publish
  uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
  with:
    target: connect
    path: subdirectory-to-use
    CONNECT_SERVER: https://connect.example.com
    CONNECT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONNECT_API_KEY }}
```

By default, `quarto publish` will re-render your project before publishing it. However, if you store the rendered output in version control, you don't need the GitHub action to re-render the project. In that case, add the option `render: false` to the `publish` action:

``` yaml
- name: Render and Publish
  uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
  with:
    target: connect
    render: false
    CONNECT_SERVER: https://connect.example.com
    CONNECT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONNECT_API_KEY }}
```
