title: "Publishing with Continuous Integration (CI)"

## Overview

Continuous Integration (CI) refers to the practice of automatically publishing content from code checked in to a version control system. While publishing using CI is a bit more involved to configure, it has several benefits, including:

-   Content is automatically published whenever source code changes (you don't need to remember to explicitly render).

-   Rendering on another system ensures that your code is reproducible (but note that this can be double-edged sword if rendering has special requirements---see the discussion below on [Rendering for CI]).

-   Not checking rendered output into version control makes diffs smaller and reduces merge conflicts.

This article covers how to implement CI for Quarto using GitHub Actions (a service run by GitHub), ordinary shell commands (which can be made to work with any CI service), and with Posit Connect.

## Rendering for CI

Before you start using a CI server you'll need to think about where you want executable code (e.g. R, Python, or Julia code) to run and where you want `quarto render` to run. You might reflexively assume that you'll always want to run everything on the CI server, however doing so introduces a number of complexities:

1.  You need to make sure that the appropriate version of Quarto is available in the CI environment.

2.  You need to reconstitute all of the dependencies (required R, Python, or Julia packages) in the CI environment.

3.  If your code needed any special permissions (e.g. database or network access) those permissions need also be present on the CI server.

4.  Your project may contain documents that can no longer be easily executed (e.g. blog posts from several years ago that use older versions of packages).

In light of the above, you can think about rendering as a continuum that extends from running everything (including `quarto render`) locally all the way up to running everything remotely on CI:

-   **Local Execution and Rendering** --- Run everything in your local environment and then check output (e.g. the `_site` directory) into version control. In this scenario the CI server is merely making sure that the checked in content is copied/deployed to the right place every time you commit. You might choose this approach to place minimal requirements on software that needs to be present on the CI server.

-   **Local Execution with CI Rendering** --- Execute R, Python, or Julia code locally and use Quarto's ability to [freeze computational output](../projects/code-execution.qmd#freeze) to save the results of computations into the `_freeze` directory. Render the site on the CI server (which will use the computations stored in `_freeze`). Use this approach when its difficult to arrange fully re-executing code on the CI server.

-   **CI Execution and Rendering** --- Execute all code and perform rendering on the CI server. While this is the gold standard of automation and reproducibility, it will require you to capture your R, Python, or Julia dependencies (e.g. in an `renv.lock` file or `requirements.txt` file) and arrange for them to be installed on the CI server. You will also need to make sure that permissions (e.g. database access) required by your code are available on the CI server.

Below we'll describe how to implement each of these strategies using [GitHub Actions], ordinary [Shell Commands] (which you should be able to adapt to any CI environment), or [Posit Connect](rstudio-connect.qmd).

## GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){data-heading="GitHub Actions"} is a Continuous Integration service from GitHub, and an excellent choice if your source code is already managed it a GitHub repository. Quarto makes available a set of [standard](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions) GitHub Actions that make it easy to install Quarto and then render and publish content.

Learn about using GitHub Actions with various publishing services here:

-   [Quarto Pub](quarto-pub#github-action)
-   [GitHub Pages](github-pages.qmd#github-action)
-   [Netlify](netlify.qmd#github-action)

If you want to use the standard Quarto actions as part of another workflow see the [GitHub Actions for Quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions) repository.

## Posit Connect

If you are publishing a source code version of your content to Posit Connect it's possible to configure Connect to retrieve the code from a Git repository and then render and execute on the Connect Server.

To learn more about this, see the documentation on [Git Backed Content](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/git-backed/) for Posit Connect.

## Shell Commands

This section covers using the `quarto publish` command on a server where no user interaction is possible. This involves the following steps:

1.  Rendering your content.
2.  Specifying where to publish (which service/server, publishing target id, etc.).
3.  Providing the appropriate publishing credentials.

{{< include _netlify-ci-example.md >}}

Below we'll cover the various components of a publishing script as well as provide a few additional complete examples.

### Rendering for Publish

By default when you execute the publish command, your site or document will be automatically re-rendered:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish
```

This is generally recommended, as it ensures that you are publishing based on the very latest version of your source code.

If you'd like to render separately (or not render at all) you can specify the `--no-render` option:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish --no-render
```

By default, the call to `quarto publish` will execute all R, Python, or Julia code contained in your project. This means that you need to ensure that the requisite version of these tools (and any required packages) are installed on the CI server. How to do this is outside the scope of this article---to learn more about saving and restoring dependencies, see the article on [Virtual Environments](../projects/virtual-environments.qmd).

If you want to execute code locally then only do markdown rendering on CI, you can use Quarto's [freeze](../projects/code-execution.html#freeze) feature. For example, if you add this to your `_quarto.yml` file:

``` yaml
execute:
  freeze: true
```

Then when you render locally computations will run and their results saved in a `_freeze` folder at the root of your project. Then, when you run `quarto publish` or `quarto render` on the CI server these computations do not need to be re-run (only markdown rendering will occur on the server).

### Publishing Destination

There are two ways to specify publishing destinations for the `quarto publish` command:

1.  Via the contents of a `_publish.yml` file created from a previous publish.
2.  Using command line parameters (e.g. `--id` and `--server`).

When you execute the `quarto publish` command, a record of your publishing destination is written to a `_publish.yml` file alongside your source code. For example:

``` yaml
- source: project
  netlify:
    - id: "5f3abafe-68f9-4c1d-835b-9d668b892001"
      url: "https://tubular-unicorn-97bb3c.netlify.app"
```

You can check the `_publish.yml` file into source control so it is available when you publish from the CI server. If you execute the `quarto publish` command with no arguments and the above `_publish.yml` is in the project directory, then the publish will target Netlify with the indicated `id`:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish netlify
```

You can also specify a publishing destination via explicit command line arguments. For example:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish netlify --id 5f3abafe-68f9-4c1d-835b-9d668b892001
```

If you have multiple publishing targets saved within `_publish.yml` then the `--id` option can be used to select from among them.

### Publishing Credentials

You can specify publishing credentials either using environment variables or via command line parameters. The following environment variables are recognized for various services:

| Service         | Variables                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Quarto Pub      | `QUARTO_PUB_AUTH_TOKEN`                |
| Netlify         | `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`                   |
| Posit Connect   | `CONNECT_SERVER` and `CONNECT_API_KEY` |

Set these environment variables within your script before calling `quarto publish`. For example:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN="45fd6ae56c"
quarto publish netlify 
```

Note that you can also specify the publishing target `--id` as a command line argument. For example:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
export CONNECT_SERVER=https://connect.example.com/
export CONNECT_API_KEY=7C0947A852D8
quarto publish connect --id DDA36416-F950-4647-815C-01A24233E294
```

### Complete Examples

Here are a few complete examples that demonstrate various ways to write publishing shell scripts:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
# publish (w/o rendering) to quarto pub based on _publish.yml
export QUARTO_PUB_AUTH_TOKEN="45fd6ae56c"
quarto publish quarto-pub --no-render
```

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
# render and publish to netlify based on _publish.yml
export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN="45fd6ae56c"
quarto publish netlify
```

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
# publish (w/o rendering) to netlify with explicit id
export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN="45fd6ae56c"
quarto publish netlify --id DDA36416-F950-4647-815C-01A24233E294 --no-render
```

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
# publish (w/o rendering) to connect based on _publish.yml
export CONNECT_SERVER=https://connect.example.com/
export CONNECT_API_KEY=7C0947A852D8
quarto publish connect --no-render
```

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
# render and publish to connect with explicit id
export CONNECT_SERVER=https://connect.example.com/
export CONNECT_API_KEY=7C0947A852D8
quarto publish connect --id DDA36416-F950-4647-815C-01A24233E294
```
