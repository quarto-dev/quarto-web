## Overview

[GitLab Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a website hosting service that enables you to publish content based on source code managed within a GitLab repository.

There s currently only one way to publish Quarto websites and documents to GitLab Pages:

1.  Use a [GitLab Pipeline] to automatically render your files (a single Quarto document or a Quarto project) and publish the resulting content whenever you push a source code change to your repository.

We'll cover each of these methods below, but first an important pre-requisite: you need to have a Git repository on your local machine that is synced to GitLab. The URL of the published website will be derived from the combination of your username and the repository name (e.g. `https://username.gitlab.io/reponame/`).

You can optionally configure a [custom domain](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/custom_domains_ssl_tls_certification/) for a GitLab Pages site, but before exploring that ground you should get your site up and running with the default domain.

### GitLab Pipeline

Before setting up the pipeline, add at least one file that will get rendered and deployed. Enable the pipeline by adding a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to your repository:

``` {.yaml filename=".gitlab-ci.yml"}
image: ghcr.io/quarto-dev/quarto:latest

pages:
  script:
    - quarto render --execute --to html --output-dir public
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
```

This pipeline will run whenever you push to your repository. It will also run when you manually trigger the pipeline from the **Build - Pipelines** page of your repository.

The pipeline will render your content and publish it to GitLab Pages using the minimal [official Docker image](https://github.com/orgs/quarto-dev/packages) from Quarto. Switch from `ghcr.io/quarto-dev/quarto:latest` to `ghcr.io/quarto-dev/quarto-full:latest` to get programming and LaTeX support.
