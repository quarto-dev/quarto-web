## Overview

[Posit Connect Cloud](https://connect.posit.cloud) is an online platform
from Posit for deploying and sharing data applications and documents.
Use Connect Cloud when you want a hosted service for publishing Quarto
documents and websites without managing your own infrastructure.

There are several ways to publish Quarto content to Connect Cloud:

1.  Use the `quarto publish` command to publish static content rendered
    on your local machine.

2.  Publish source content from a [GitHub repository][gh-publish] for
    server-side rendering with automatic redeployment on push.

3.  Publish source content from an [IDE][ide-publish] (Positron, VS Code,
    or RStudio).

Each of these options is covered below. If you are just getting started,
we recommend using `quarto publish` (the first approach).

## Publish Command

The `quarto publish` command is the easiest way to publish locally rendered
content. From the directory where your project is located, execute:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish posit-connect-cloud
```

If you haven't previously published to Connect Cloud, a browser will open
to authenticate using your Posit account:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
$ quarto publish posit-connect-cloud
 ? Open a browser to authenticate (Y/n) ›
```

After authenticating, your content will be rendered and deployed, and a
browser will open to view your published content on Connect Cloud.

A record of your previous publishes will be stored in a `_publish.yml`
file within the project or document directory. For example:

``` yaml
- source: project
  posit-connect-cloud:
    - id: "5f3abafe-68f9-4c1d-835b-9d668b892001"
      url: "https://connect.posit.cloud/content/..."
```

Account information is not stored in this file, so it is suitable for
checking in to version control and being shared by multiple publishers.

You can customize the behavior of `quarto publish` by providing the
following command line options:

{{< include _cli-options.md >}}

To publish a document rather than a website or book, provide the path
to the document:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish posit-connect-cloud document.qmd
```

### Multiple Accounts

If you have multiple Posit accounts, you'll be prompted to choose which
account to publish with. You can manage stored accounts using:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish accounts
```

## Publishing Source Content

The `quarto publish` command publishes pre-rendered content (static HTML).
To publish source content for server-side rendering on Connect Cloud, use
one of the following methods.

### GitHub

Connect Cloud can publish directly from a GitHub repository. When you push
changes to the connected branch, Connect Cloud automatically re-renders and
redeploys your content. This is ideal for scheduled reports and collaborative
projects.

See the Connect Cloud documentation on [Publishing from GitHub][gh-publish]
for setup instructions and details.

### IDE

You can publish source content directly from your editor using:

-   **Posit Publisher** --- A VS Code / Positron extension for deploying
    content to Connect Cloud. Pre-installed in Positron; available from the
    VS Code Marketplace for VS Code.

-   **rsconnect** --- The rsconnect R package can deploy R content
    programmatically from RStudio or any R session.

See the Connect Cloud documentation on [Publishing from an IDE][ide-publish]
for setup instructions and details.

## Continuous Integration

You can publish to Connect Cloud from a CI service by scripting the
`quarto publish` command with environment variables for authentication:

| Variable                              | Description                                       |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `POSIT_CONNECT_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN`    | OAuth access token for authentication (required). |
| `POSIT_CONNECT_CLOUD_REFRESH_TOKEN`   | OAuth refresh token (required).                   |
| `POSIT_CONNECT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID`      | Account ID to publish with (optional, auto-selects if only one account). |

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
export POSIT_CONNECT_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN="..."
export POSIT_CONNECT_CLOUD_REFRESH_TOKEN="..."
quarto publish posit-connect-cloud --no-prompt --no-browser
```

See the article on [Publishing with CI](ci.qmd) for additional details
on non-interactive use of `quarto publish`.
