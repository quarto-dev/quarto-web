## Overview

[Posit Connect Cloud](https://connect.posit.cloud) is an online platform
from Posit for deploying and sharing data applications and documents.
Use Posit Connect Cloud when you want a hosted service for publishing Quarto
documents and websites without managing your own infrastructure.
Posit Connect Cloud includes a free tier that allows unlimited publishing of static documents.

There are several ways to publish Quarto content to Posit Connect Cloud:

1.  Use the `quarto publish` command to publish locally rendered static content.

2.  Publish source content from a [GitHub repository][gh-publish]. 
    The source is rendered by Posit Connect Cloud, and redeployed automatically when content is pushed to the repository.

3.  Publish source content from an [IDE][ide-publish] (Positron, VS Code,
    or RStudio).

4.  Script the `quarto publish` command to publish from a Continuous Integration (CI) service.

Each of these options is covered below. If you are just getting started,
we recommend using the first approach, `quarto publish`.

## Publish Command

The `quarto publish` command is the easiest way to publish locally rendered
content. From the directory where your project is located, execute:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish posit-connect-cloud
```

If you haven't previously published to Posit Connect Cloud, a browser will open
to authenticate using your Posit account:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
$ quarto publish posit-connect-cloud
? Authorize (Y/n) › 
❯ In order to publish to Posit Connect Cloud you need to authorize your account.
  Please be sure you are logged into the correct Posit Connect Cloud account in your
  default web browser, then press Enter or 'Y' to authorize.
```

After authenticating, your content will be rendered and deployed, and a
browser will open to view your published content on Posit Connect Cloud.

A record of your previous publishes will be stored in a `_publish.yml`
file within the project or document directory. For example:

```{.yaml filename="_publish.yml"}
- source: project
  posit-connect-cloud:
    - id: "5f3abafe-68f9-4c1d-835b-9d668b892001"
      url: "https://connect.posit.cloud/content/..."
```

Account information is not stored in this file, so it is suitable for
checking in to version control and being shared by multiple publishers.

You can customize the behavior of `quarto publish` by providing the
following command line options:

{{< include _cli-options.md >}}

To publish a document rather than a website or book, provide the path
to the document:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish posit-connect-cloud document.qmd
```

### Multiple Accounts

If you have multiple Posit accounts, you'll be prompted to choose which
account to publish with. You can manage stored accounts using:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish accounts
```

## Publish from GitHub

Posit Connect Cloud can publish directly from a GitHub repository. When you push
changes to the connected branch, Posit Connect Cloud automatically re-renders and
redeploys your content. This is ideal for scheduled reports and collaborative
projects.

See the Posit Connect Cloud documentation on [Publishing from GitHub][gh-publish]
for setup instructions and details.

## Publish from your IDE

You can publish source content directly from your editor using:

-   **Posit Publisher** --- A VS Code / Positron extension for deploying
    content to Posit Connect Cloud. Pre-installed in Positron; available from the
    VS Code Marketplace for VS Code.

-   **rsconnect** --- The rsconnect R package can deploy R content
    programmatically from RStudio or any R session.

See the Posit Connect Cloud documentation on [Publishing from an IDE][ide-publish]
for setup instructions and details.

## Continuous Integration

You can publish to Posit Connect Cloud from a CI service by scripting the
`quarto publish` command with environment variables for authentication.
These tokens are generated during the interactive `quarto publish` flow
and stored locally --- use `quarto publish accounts` to view stored
credentials.

| Variable                              | Description                                       |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `POSIT_CONNECT_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN`    | OAuth access token for authentication (required). |
| `POSIT_CONNECT_CLOUD_REFRESH_TOKEN`   | OAuth refresh token (required).                   |
| `POSIT_CONNECT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID`      | Account ID to publish with (required if you have multiple accounts). |

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
export POSIT_CONNECT_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN="..."
export POSIT_CONNECT_CLOUD_REFRESH_TOKEN="..."
quarto publish posit-connect-cloud --no-prompt --no-browser
```

See the article on [Publishing with CI](ci.qmd) for additional details
on non-interactive use of `quarto publish`.
