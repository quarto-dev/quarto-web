## What Is GitHub Codespaces?

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is a cloud-powered, on-demand development environment that runs either in your browser or in Visual Studio Code via the [GitHub Codespaces extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces).
It eliminates the need for lengthy local setup by providing a fully configured development container, complete with all necessary dependencies and tools.
This means that whether you're an instructor or a developer, you can start coding immediately with a consistent environment tailored to your specific project, right on your web browser.

More importantly, the participants of your workshops can use GitHub Codespaces just as easily as you can.
With Codespaces, you and your participants all work on identical environments, minimising the "it doesn't work on my machine" problems we are all too aware of.

In this post, I am assuming the case of a workshop instructor and a room full of participants with different laptops and operating systems.
Codespaces are also useful for development, though, as you will notice reading on.

## The Power of Combining Quarto CLI with Codespaces

Imagine a world where your participants are instantly equipped with the same environment with all the tools, libraries, and sample projects ready to go in the cloud.
That's the magic of using Codespaces:

1. **Immediate Onboarding:** Workshop participants or students can bypass the hassle of local setup.
   They simply launch a Codespace (running on their web browser of choice, independently of operating system), and the pre-configured environment is available immediately.

1. **A Consistent Environment:** Ensuring that everyone has the same tools and dependencies can be challenging.
   Codespaces lets you pre-define your environment with container configurations, reducing the risk of discrepancies in software versions or settings.

2. **Reproducible Workflows:** Whether you're teaching a data science workshop or collaborating on a research paper, reproducibility is crucial.
   Because GitHub Codespaces uses the [Dev Container specification](https://containers.dev/), you can ensure that your code can be run in the same environment.
   When participants are ready to run their projects locally, they can use Codespace to build an equivalent Docker container.

GitHub provides ["deep link"](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/setting-up-your-repository/facilitating-quick-creation-and-resumption-of-codespaces) to Codespaces, allowing you to create a link you can share with your students or workshop participants.

```markdown
[![](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces?quickstart=1&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json)
```

The link can include a specific branch, a particular file, or even a specific line in a file.
By doing nothing more than clicking that one link, participants create or resume an existing execution environment.

## Setting Up Your Own Quarto-Codespaces Environment

If you're considering using Codespaces with Quarto CLI for your next workshop or teaching module, here's how to get started:

Leverage the example provided by the [`quarto-codespaces` repository](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces) or [create your own Codespaces using the default](https://github.com/codespaces/new/).

### Use an Existing Docker Image {#sec-use-existing-docker-image}

The easiest way to get started is to use an existing Docker image that has Quarto CLI and all the dependencies you need.
There are several pre-built images available with or without the Quarto CLI:

- Official Docker images:
  - [`ghcr.io/quarto-dev/quarto`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pkgs/container/quarto)
  - [`ghcr.io/quarto-dev/quarto-full`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pkgs/container/quarto-full)
- Community Docker images:
  - [`ghcr.io/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces`](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces/pkgs/container/quarto-codespaces)
- Default Codespaces image:
  - [`mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/universal`](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/tree/main/src/universal)

You can use any of these images as a base for your Codespace.
Inside the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file, you can specify the image you want to use.
The `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file serves as the blueprint for your Codespace.

```json
{
  "name": "My Workshop Setup",
  "image": "ghcr.io/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces:latest", // <1>
  "remoteUser": "vscode",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "quarto.quarto", // <2>
        "mcanouil.quarto-wizard" // <3>
      ]
    },
    "codespaces": {
      "openFiles": [ // <4>
        "exercises/intro-to-quarto.qmd",
        "exercises/computation.qmd"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

1. The Docker image is specified in the `image` field.
   It's built using a Dev Container specification that you can find in [`.github/.devcontainer`](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces/tree/main/.github/.devcontainer).
2. The [`quarto` extension](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto) for Visual Studio Code / Positron to provide support for Quarto documents.
3. The [`quarto-wizard` extension](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-wizard) for Visual Studio Code / Positron to provide assistance in managing Quarto extensions
4. The `openFiles` field specifies the files to open when the Codespace is created.
   This is useful for guiding participants to the right files or folders.
   See the [Codespaces documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/configuring-dev-containers/automatically-opening-files-in-the-codespaces-for-a-repository) for more information.

### Configure the Development Container

You can fork the [`quarto-codespaces` repository](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces) as a starting point for your own Codespaces.
This repository includes the Dev Container configuration file (*i.e.*, `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`) that instruct Codespaces on how to set up an environment complete with Quarto CLI and other essential tools.
The `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` configuration file ensures that every instance of your Codespace is identical, capturing everything from the Quarto CLI version to additional libraries or extensions you might need.
The [`quarto-codespaces` repository](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces) is a great starting point as it provides a prebuilt Docker image with the latest Quarto CLI, Python, R, and Julia installed (*i.e.*, [`ghcr.io/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces`](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces/pkgs/container/quarto-codespaces) using [`.github/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces/tree/main/.github/.devcontainer)).

```json
{
  "name": "Quarto",
  // "image": "buildpack-deps:jammy-curl", // <1>
  "build": {
    "dockerfile": "./Dockerfile",
    "context": ".",
    "args": {
      "VARIANT": "jammy"
    }
  },
  "remoteUser": "vscode",
  "features": { // <2>
    "./quarto-computing-dependencies": { // <3>
      "rDeps": "rmarkdown,languageserver,nx10/httpgd@v2.0.3,prompt,lintr",
      "pythonDeps": "jupyter,papermill",
      "juliaDeps": "IJulia"
    },
    "./uv": { // <4>
      "version": "latest"
    },
    "ghcr.io/rocker-org/devcontainer-features/quarto-cli:1": { // <5>
      "version": "release",
      "installTinyTex": "true",
      "installChromium": "false"
    }
  },
  "customizations": { // <6>
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "quarto.quarto",
        "mcanouil.quarto-wizard",
        "REditorSupport.r",
        "Posit.air-vscode"
      ],
      "settings": {
        "r.rterm.option": [
          "--no-save",
          "--no-restore-data",
          "--quiet"
        ],
        "[r]": {
          "editor.defaultFormatter": "Posit.air-vscode",
          "editor.formatOnSave": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. The `image` field specifies the base image for the container.
   You can customise this to suit your needs.
2. The `features` section allows you to add additional tools or libraries.
   See the [Dev Container Features available](https://containers.dev/features/) for a comprehensive list of available features.
3. The `quarto-computing-dependencies` feature is a "local" custom feature that installs the computing dependencies: R, Python, and Julia.
   This is a great way to ensure that your Codespace has everything it needs to run Quarto documents.
4. The `uv` feature installs the [`uv` tool](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python packages and project dependencies.
5. The `quarto-cli` feature installs the Quarto CLI.
   You can specify the version you want to install, and it will be automatically downloaded and installed in your Codespace.
   You can see the code for this feature in the source repository: <https://github.com/rocker-org/devcontainer-features/tree/main/src/quarto-cli>.
6. The `customizations` section allows you to specify settings and extensions for Visual Studio Code.

You can also add additional features to the `devcontainer.json` to suit your needs or start directly using the image as is as shown in @sec-use-existing-docker-image.
For example, you might want to add additional R packages or Python libraries.
You can do this by using the `quarto-computing-dependencies` custom feature and chaning the `rDeps`, `pythonDeps`, and `juliaDeps` fields to include the packages you want to install globally, or by using the `postStartCommand` field to run a script that installs the packages you need.

```json
{
  "name": "My Workshop Setup",
  "image": "ghcr.io/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces:latest",
  "remoteUser": "vscode",
  "postStartCommand": "uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate && uv pip install -r requirements.txt"
}
```

You can also use the `postStartCommand` field to run a script that installs the packages you need.

```json
{
  "name": "My Workshop Setup",
  "image": "ghcr.io/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces:latest",
  "remoteUser": "vscode",
  "postStartCommand": "bash ./init-env.sh --what all --force" // <1>
}
```

1. The `postStartCommand` field specifies a command to run after the Codespace is started.
   In this case, it runs the [`init-env.sh` script](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces/blob/main/init-env.sh) from [`quarto-codespaces` repository](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-codespaces) with the `--what all` and `--force` options.

## Benefits for Workshops and Teaching

When it comes to educational sessions, consistency and ease-of-use are paramount.
Pairing Codespaces with Quarto CLI brings many direct benefits to a teaching environment:

- **Streamlined Onboarding:** Students and workshop attendees can get right to work without spending time installing and configuring local environments.
- **Live, Interactive Sessions:** Instructors can demonstrate live edits to Quarto documents.
  Changes can be rendered instantly and reflect in each participant's environment: perfect for a hands-on, interactive learning experience.
- **Collaboration and Version Control:** All changes can be recorded in Git, making it easy to track progress, handle peer reviews, and manage collaborative projects, all within a single hosted environment.
- **Elimination of "Dependency Hell":** With containerised development, all attendees work from the same baseline, ensuring that version conflicts or missing libraries don't derail a session.

## Final Thoughts and Future Directions

Whether you're running a workshop, teaching a class, or collaborating on research, using Codespaces can reduce setup hassles, foster reproducibility, and encourage interactive learning.

In addition to the benefits mentioned above, other features further enhance your experience with Codespaces and Quarto CLI:

- **Automated Pipelines:** Integrating CI/CD tools to automatically validate Quarto document renders and catch errors using the exact same environment.
  See [GitHub Actions: Running jobs in a container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-where-your-workflow-runs/running-jobs-in-a-container)
- **Real-Time Co-Editing Features:** Enhancing collaborative sessions with simultaneous multi-user editing directly in Codespaces.
  See [GitHub Codespaces: Real-time collaboration](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/working-collaboratively-in-a-codespace)
