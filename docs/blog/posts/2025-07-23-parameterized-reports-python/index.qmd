## Based on a talk at SciPy 2025

This post is based on the talk "From One Notebook to Many Reports: Automating with Quarto" delivered at [SciPy 2025](https://www.scipy2025.scipy.org) by Charlotte Wickham. 
You can find the slides at [cwickham.github.io/one-notebook-many-reports](https://cwickham.github.io/one-notebook-many-reports/) and example code at [github.com/cwickham/one-notebook-many-reports](https://github.com/cwickham/one-notebook-many-reports).

## The Problem: Repetitive Reporting

Would you rather read a generic "Climate summary" or a "Climate summary for _exactly where you live_"? Reports that are personalized to a specific situation increase engagement and connection. But producing many customized reports manually is tedious and error-prone.

Quarto solves this with parameterized reports---you create a single document template, then render it multiple times with different parameter values to generate customized outputs automatically.

A great example is the customized soil health reports from Washington Soil Health Initiative's [State of the Soils Assessment](https://washingtonsoilhealthinitiative.com/state-of-the-soils/), presented at posit::conf(2023) by [Jadey Ryan](https://jadeyryan.com) (watch on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/lbE5uOqfT70?si=C-d5U5Q2VXo1wlDs)). Jadey demonstrated this approach using R and plain text Quarto files (`.qmd`).

This post shows you how to apply the same principles using Python: we'll walk through converting a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) into a parameterized report, then automating the generation of multiple customized outputs. Then I'll give you some tips for making your reports look polished.

## The Solution: Parameterized Reports

### Start with a notebook

As an example, let's start with a Jupyter notebook analyzing climate data for Corvallis, Oregon. 

![[`corvallis.ipynb`](https://github.com/cwickham/one-notebook-many-reports/blob/main/01-one-notebook/corvallis.ipynb)](corvallis-ipynb.png){#corvallis-ipynb .column-margin fig-alt="Screenshot of a Jupyter notebook with code cells and output, including a plot and text summary."}

You can see the full notebook, [`corvallis.ipynb`, on GitHub](https://github.com/cwickham/one-notebook-many-reports/blob/main/01-one-notebook/corvallis.ipynb), but here are the key pieces:

-   The code cells import some data for all of Oregon, and filter it to just rows relevant for Corvallis, then produce a summary sentence and a plot.

-   The document options specify `echo: false` so no code appears in the final output, and `format: typst` so the output is a PDF produced via [Typst](https://typst.app), a modern alternative to LaTeX.

This single notebook can be rendered with Quarto:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render corvallis.ipynb 
```

The result is a PDF file, `corvallis.pdf`, a simple report with the title "Corvallis" and a single sentence summary of the climate data, along with a plot highlighting the mean temperature for this year against the last 30 years.

![`corvallis.pdf`](corvallis-pdf.png){.column-margin fig-alt="Screenshot of a PDF file with the title 'Corvallis' that contains a single sentence summary and a plot."}

Now, imagine we want to create this report for the 50 largest cities in Oregon.
Here's the steps we'll take: 

1. Turn hardcoded values into variables
2. Declare those variables parameters
3. Render the notebook with different parameter values
4. Automate rendering with many parameter values 

### 1. Turn hardcoded values into variables

We want a report for each city.
We'll start by creating a variable, `city`, which we'll designate a parameter in our next step.
In a new code cell at the top of our notebook, we define the variable:

````{.python filename="code"}
city = "Corvallis"
````    

Then anywhere we previously hardcoded `"Corvallis"` in the notebook, we replace it with this variable. 

The first occurrence is in the title of the document.
Originally, we had a markdown cell defining a level 1 heading:

```{.markdown filename="markdown"}
# Corvallis
```

We replace it with a code cell that uses an f-string to produce markdown for a level 1 heading based on the `city` variable:

```{.markdown filename="code"}
Markdown(f"# {city}")
```

In the filtering step the replacement is straightforward, we just change the string to the variable:

::: {layout-ncol="2"}

:::{}
Before:

```{.python filename="code"}
tmean = tmean_oregon.filter(
    pl.col("city") == "Corvallis",
)
```
:::

:::{}
After:

```{.python filename="code"}
tmean = tmean_oregon.filter(
    pl.col("city") == city,
)
```
:::
::: 

Finally, the plot code (using [plotnine](https://plotnine.org)), sets the title of the plot to include the city name:

```{.python filename="code"}
...
+ labs(title = "Corvallis, OR", ...)
...
```

We can also use an f-string here to include the `city` variable:

```{.python filename="code"}
...
+ labs(title = f"{city}, OR", ...)
...
```

Now, we should be able to test our changes by explicitly setting the `city` variable to something other than "Corvallis" and re-running the cells.
Since our report is no longer specific to Corvallis, we can rename it `climate.ipynb`.

### 2. Declare those variables parameters

Now we have a variable that represents the parameter, we need to let Quarto know it's a parameter.
Quarto's parameterized reports are implemented using [Papermill](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and inherit Papermill's approach: tag the cell defining the parameter with `parameters`.

In Jupyter, you can add this tag through the cell toolbar:

![](corvallis-add-tag.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of a Jupyter notebook cell with a tag 'parameters' added to it."}

::: {.callout-tip}

## `jupyter` vs `knitr` 

Setting parameters differs based on the engine you are using in Quarto.
With a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`), or a plain text Quarto document (`.qmd`) with only Python code cells, Quarto will default to the `jupyter` engine.
As described above, the `jupyter` engine uses cell tags to identify parameters. 

If you are working in a `.ipynb` file, your IDE will likely provide a way to add these tags through the cell toolbar.
If you are working in a `.qmd` file, you can add the tags as code cell options:

````markdown
```{{python}}
#| tags: [parameters]
city = "Corvallis"
```
````

If you are working in a Quarto document (`.qmd`) with R code cells, Quarto will default to the  `knitr` engine.
With the `knitr` engine, you set parameters in the document header under `params`:

```yaml
---
params:
  city: "Corvallis"
---
```

In `knitr`, parameters are accessed as elements of `params`, e.g. `params$city`, rather than as global variables like `city`.

You can see the updated notebook (now a parameterized report), [`climate.ipynb`, on GitHub](https://github.com/cwickham/one-notebook-many-reports/blob/main/03-many-reports/climate.ipynb).

### 3. Render with different parameter values

If we render `climate.ipynb`, it will still produce the same report for Corvallis, because we haven't changed the parameter value:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render climate.ipynb
```

But we can now pass parameter values to Quarto with the `-P` flag:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
# Generate report for Portland
quarto render climate.ipynb -P city:Portland --output-file portland.pdf

# Generate report for Eugene  
quarto render climate.ipynb -P city:Eugene --output-file eugene.pdf
```

We've also added `--output-file` to ensure each report gets its own filename.

### 4. Automate rendering with many parameter values 

To generate all 50 reports, we need to run `quarto render` 50 times, each time with a different city as the parameter value.
You could automate this in many ways, but let's use a Python script.
For example, you might have a dataset of cities and their corresponding output filenames:

```python
cities = pl.DataFrame({
    "city": ["Portland", "Cottage Grove", "St. Helens", "Eugene"],
    "output_file": ["portland.pdf", "cottage_grove.pdf", "st_helens.pdf", "eugene.pdf"]
})
```

I've generated a small example above, but in reality you would likely read `cities` in from a file.
Then you could iterate over the rows of this dataset, rendering the notebook for each city:

```python
from quarto import render
for row in cities.iter_rows(named=True):
    render(
        "climate.ipynb",
        execute_params={"city": row["city"]},
        output_file=row["output_file"],
    )
```

Run this script once, and you'll get all 50 custom reports!

## Pretty Reports: Brand and Typst

The steps above to produce parameterized reports apply to any output format supported by Quarto.
However, if you are targeting `typst` you can take advantage of additional features to create beautiful PDF reports.

### Brand.yml

Quarto supports [brand.yml](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/) a way to specify colors, fonts, and logos:

```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
color:
  palette:
    forest-green: "#2d5a3d"     
    charcoal-grey: "#555555"    
  foreground: charcoal-grey    
  primary: forest-green       
typography:
  fonts:
    - family: Open Sans
      source: google
  base:
    family: Open Sans
logo:
  medium: logo.png
```

Quarto will detect the `_brand.yml` file and apply the colors, fonts and logo to your report.
Colors and fonts in your figures will need to be customized in your code, but that is made much easier with the [brand-yml](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/pkg/py/) Python package which imports your values from `_brand.yml`.

You can see a full example of using `_brand.yml` with `climate.ipynb` at [cwickham/one-notebook-many-reports/04-branded-reports](https://github.com/cwickham/scipy-talk/tree/main/04-branded-reports), and learn more about Quarto's support for brand in the [Brand guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/brand.html).


### Typst

Learning a little bit of Typst syntax can take your reports from basic to beautiful. 
You can include [raw Typst syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst.html#raw-typst) in your notebooks, or wrap elements in Typst functions using the [typst-function Quarto extension](https://github.com/christopherkenny/typst-function).
As an example, you could add a header with the city name and a map of the location:

![`corvallis.pdf`](corvallis-pretty-pdf.png){fig-alt="The `corvallis.ipynb` notebook rendered by Quarto to `pdf`. The document has dark green header with the city in white text and a map next to it with the location as an orange dot." } 

You can see the source for this example at [cwickham/one-notebook-many-reports/05-pretty-reports](https://github.com/cwickham/one-notebook-many-reports/tree/main/05-pretty-reports).

## Wrapping Up

Parameterized reports turn one notebook into many customized outputs. 
You've seen the process of going from a notebook with a hardcoded value to a parameterized report that can be rendered with different values.
You can then automate the rendering in any way you choose to generate dozens of reports at once.
