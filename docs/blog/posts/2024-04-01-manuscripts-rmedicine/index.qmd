Recently I gave a webinar for R/Medicine titled "Quarto for Reproducible Medical Manuscripts". You can watch the video below or on the R Consortium website at <https://www.r-consortium.org/r-medicine-quarto-for-reproducible-medical-manuscripts>.[^1]

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1onTLcgY4 >}}

Some highlights from the webinar include:

-   Step-by-step instructions for getting started with a new manuscript project
-   Obtaining multiple formats from one source
-   An overview of the rich front matter
-   Embedding computations from supplementary notebooks
    -   Note that I demoed embedding computations in R from .qmd files however it's also possible to embed computations from Jupyter notebooks and computations done in Python.
-   A live-coding demo of authoring Quarto manuscripts with RStudio and all the bells-and-whistles of the visual editor, including:
    -   cross referencing
    -   citations
    -   inline code
-   Ability to actually interact with code from a manuscript with Binder
-   And a rich Q&A thanks to the audience!

The slides (also written in Quarto!) and their source code can be found at the links below:

In addition, the webinar featured a reproduction of a medical manuscript with Quarto.[^2] Materials from this reproduction can be found at the links below:

-   Manuscript homepage: <https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/indo-rct>

    -   This is an HTML page but you can also access PDF and MS Word versions of the manuscript by clicking on their respective links.

    -   You can also find a link to the Binder instance for this manuscript.[^3]

-   Source code for manuscript: <https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/indo-rct>

[^1]: Huge thanks to the R Consortium for hosting the webinar and making the recording available so quickly!

[^2]: Huge thanks to [Peter Higgins](https://github.com/higgi13425) who pointed me to this article and the R package that contains code from the article ([**medicaldata**](https://higgi13425.github.io/medicaldata/)) and shared some starter code with me.

[^3]: The Binder instance takes a few minutes to launch, you can leave that running in a tab while you browse the rest of the manuscript in another tab.
