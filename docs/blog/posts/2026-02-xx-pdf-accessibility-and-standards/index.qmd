title: PDF Accessibility and Standards
---

2025 was a big year for PDF accessibility. LaTeX and Typst both released support for PDF tagging and accessibility standards, just in time for new regulations in the EU (June 2025) and US (April 2026)

Currently LaTeX supports the newer UA-2 standard, and Typst supports the older UA-1 standard. Typst is likely to have UA-2 support later in 2026.

Both standards instruct the PDF renderer to provide screen readers:

* The semantic structure of the text (title, heading, paragraph, figure, etc)
* The natural reading order
* Spatial coordinates for highlighting and assistive navigation
* Required metadata such as title and language

## Enabling a PDF Standard for Accessibility

In Quarto 1.9, specify a PDF standard for your document or project with `pdf-standard`

::: panel-tabset
## PDF (LaTeX)

```yaml
format:
  pdf:
    pdf-standard: ua-2
```

## Typst

```yaml
format:
  typst:
    pdf-standard: ua-1
```
:::

`pdf-standard` takes a single standard name or list of standard names.PDF version is used if provided in the list, but otherwise inferred from the standard.

If you specify a PDF standard, Quarto first instructs LaTeX or Typst to use the standard when producing the PDF, and then validates the output PDF against the standard using veraPDF, an open-source PDF validation tool. 

## Markdown is naturally good for Accessibility

Quarto doesn't guarantee PDF accessibility compliance, but its Markdown-based workflow handles many requirements automatically:

* Document metadata (title, author, date, language) flows into the PDF's built-in metadata fields.
* The semantic structure of Markdown satisfies PDF tagging requirements. For Typst this is always enabled; for LaTeX it is enabled when you specify a standard that requires it.
* Alt text for images is carried through to the PDF for screen readers.

See the [LaTeX](https://prerelease.quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html#accessibility-requirements) and [Typst](https://prerelease.quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst.html#accessibility-requirements) documentation for details.

## What to expect

We ran our test suite, with 188 LaTeX examples and 317 Typst examples, in order to see: 

* Where Quarto produces PDFs that do not pass UA-1 or UA-2.
* Where users will need to change their documents to meet accessibility standards

### Both formats

Your document needs a title.

Your document needs alt text and/or a caption for every image.

### LaTeX

Margin notes are the biggest structural blocker. The `sidenotes` and `marginnote` LaTeX packages [do not cooperate with PDF Tagging](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/14103).

There are smaller upstream issues in Pandoc, LaTeX, and LaTeX packages, [documented here](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/14097#issuecomment-3947653207). 

We expect that as awareness of accessibility and UA-2 spreads, these problems will get fixed upstream. Please search for [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/quarto-dev/discussions) and file a new one if essential features of PDF output in Quarto fail UA-2.

### Typst

In our tests, Typst catches every UA-1 violation, and fails to generate the PDF. veraPDF did not detect any violation that Typst did not.

Typst also seems to do a very good job of generating UA-1 compliant output by default - almost all errors were titles and alt text.

However, we did discover that Typst Books are not yet compliant. There is [structural problem with the Typst orange-book package](https://github.com/flavio20002/typst-orange-template/issues/38) and we'll work with the maintainers to correct it.
