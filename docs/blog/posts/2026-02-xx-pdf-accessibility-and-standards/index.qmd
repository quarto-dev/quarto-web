title: PDF Accessibility and Standards
---

2025 was a big year for PDF accessibility. LaTeX and Typst both released support for PDF tagging and accessibility standards, just in time for new regulations in the [EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Accessibility_Act) (June 2025) and [US](https://accessible.org/ada-title-ii-web-accessibility/) (April 2026).  

Quarto 1.9 brings this support to you as a Quarto user.

## What PDF Standards Do

Currently LaTeX supports the newer UA-2 standard, and Typst supports the older UA-1 standard. Typst is likely to have UA-2 support later in 2026.

Both standards instruct the PDF renderer to provide screen readers:

* The semantic structure of the text (title, heading, paragraph, figure, etc)
* The natural reading order
* Spatial coordinates for highlighting and assistive navigation
* Required metadata such as title and language

## How to enable a PDF Standard in Quarto

In Quarto 1.9, specify a PDF standard for your document or project with `pdf-standard`

::: panel-tabset
## PDF (LaTeX)

```yaml
format:
  pdf:
    pdf-standard: ua-2
```

## Typst

```yaml
format:
  typst:
    pdf-standard: ua-1
```
:::

`pdf-standard` takes a single standard name or list of standard names. PDF version is used if provided in the list, but otherwise inferred from the standard.

If you specify a PDF standard, Quarto first instructs LaTeX or Typst to use the standard when producing the PDF, and then validates the output PDF against the standard using veraPDF, an open-source PDF validation tool.

::: {.callout-note}
## Installing veraPDF

veraPDF requires a separate install:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto install verapdf
```

veraPDF requires Java.

:::

When a document passes validation, you'll see output like:

```
[verapdf]: Validating my-document.pdf against PDF/UA-2... PASSED
```

## Creating accessible PDFs

Quarto's Markdown-based workflow handles many accessibility requirements automatically:

* Document metadata (title, author, date, language) flows into the PDF's built-in metadata fields.
* The semantic structure of Markdown satisfies PDF tagging requirements. For Typst this is always enabled; for LaTeX it is enabled when you specify a standard that requires it.
* Alt text for images is carried through to the PDF for screen readers.

But you do need to make sure your document has:

* A **title** in the YAML front matter.
* **Alt text for every image**, specified with `fig-alt`. See [Figures](/docs/authoring/figures.qmd) for details.

See the [LaTeX](https://prerelease.quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html#accessibility-requirements) and [Typst](https://prerelease.quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst.html#accessibility-requirements) documentation for more details.

## Current limitations

We ran our test suite -- 188 LaTeX examples and 317 Typst examples -- to find where Quarto PDFs do not yet pass UA-1 or UA-2, and where users will need to change their documents.

### LaTeX

Margin content is the biggest structural blocker. If you use `.column-margin` divs, `cap-location: margin`, `reference-location: margin`, or `citation-location: margin`, the resulting PDF will not pass UA-2. The underlying `sidenotes` and `marginnote` LaTeX packages [do not cooperate with PDF tagging](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/14103). 

(Margin content does work with Typst and passes UA-1 -- see [Typst Article Layout](/docs/output-formats/typst.qmd#article-layout).)

There are smaller upstream issues in Pandoc, LaTeX, and LaTeX packages, [documented here](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/14097#issuecomment-3947653207).

### Typst

In our tests, Typst catches every UA-1 violation, and fails to generate the PDF. veraPDF did not detect any violation that Typst did not.

Typst also seems to do a very good job of generating UA-1 compliant output by default -- almost all errors were titles and alt text.

However, we did discover that [Typst Books](/docs/books/book-output.qmd#typst-output) are not yet compliant. There is a [structural problem with the Typst orange-book package](https://github.com/flavio20002/typst-orange-template/issues/38) and we'll work with the maintainers to correct it.

We expect PDF accessibility support to improve upstream throughout 2026 as awareness of UA-2 and the new regulations spreads. If you run into accessibility issues with PDF output, please search the [Quarto discussions](https://github.com/orgs/quarto-dev/discussions) and open a new one with the `accessibility` label for any issues you discover.
