Publishing Quarto projects to GitHub Pages can seem daunting, but with the right approach, it's a breeze.  
This blog post will walk you through various methods to deploy your Quarto creations, from simple manual steps to automated workflows using GitHub Actions.  
By the end, you'll have the know-how to share your dynamic documents, books, and websites seamlessly with the world.

Let's dive into the essentials of making your Quarto project live on GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

::: {.callout-important}
Before proceeding, ensure you have enabled and configured GitHub Pages for your repository (*i.e.*, `https://github.com/<username>/<repository>/settings/pages`), see [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) for more details.
:::

The following methods mostly assume your GitHub repository is public.
If your repository is private, you may need to adjust the settings to allow GitHub Pages to access the repository using a personal access token.

You can use the Quarto project created with the `quarto create project website` command as a demo project to try out the methods described in this guide.
This will provide a practical example to follow along with.

## Manual Approach

### Using Quarto CLI

The manual method involves using the Quarto Command Line Interface (CLI) to publish your project.
This method is straightforward and requires minimal setup.

```sh
quarto publish gh-pages
```

Check out the Quarto CLI help for more details on the `publish` command.

```sh
quarto publish --help
```

::: {.callout-note}
The `gh-pages` branch is used to publish to GitHub Pages.

`quarto publish gh-pages` setups the `gh-pages` branch, renders your project, and pushes the output to the branch.  
You can use the `--no-render` flag to skip rendering and only push a previously rendered project.
:::

## Automated Approach

Automation can streamline the publishing process and reduce the risk of errors.
Here are two automated methods using GitHub Actions.

::: {.callout-important}
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create and manage GitHub Actions workflows in your repository (*i.e.*, `https://github.com/<username>/<repository>/settings/actions`), see [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for more details.

### Quarto Publish GitHub Action

Quarto provides an official GitHub Action that simplifies the publishing process.
This action takes care of the entire workflow but **requires** to use `quarto publish gh-pages` locally at least once to set up the `gh-pages` branch.

```{.yaml filename=".github/workflows/deploy.yml"}
name: Deploy

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: read

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: 
      contents: write
      pages: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
        with:
          version: pre-release
      # Add any additional steps as needed, such as installing dependencies
      - name: Build and Deploy
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
```

::: {.callout-note}
The `quarto-dev/quarto-actions` GitHub Actions are maintained by the Quarto team.  
You can find more information about these actions in the [Quarto Actions repository](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions).
:::

### Custom GitHub Actions Workflow

For more control over the publishing process, you can set up a custom GitHub Actions workflow.
We'll discuss two scenarios:

- [**Deploy from a branch**](#deploy-from-a-branch) ([Deploy from a branch - GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-from-a-branch))  
  *Classic Pages experience, where the content is published from a specific branch root or `/docs` folder.*

- [**GitHub Actions**](#github-actions) ([GitHub Actions - GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow))  
  *Best for using frameworks and customizing your build process.*

#### Deploy From a Branch

You can configure a workflow to publish your Quarto project whenever changes are pushed to a specific branch (*e.g.*, `main`) and deploy the output to GitHub Pages from a specific folder/branch.

::: {.callout-note}
The GitHub Action workflow described in [Quarto Publish GitHub Action](#quarto-publish-github-action) uses `gh-pages` root as the source for GitHub Pages.
:::

##### Deploying From the `docs` Folder (*e.g.*, `main` Branch)

Using the `docs` folder as the source for GitHub Pages. Be sure to use a Quarto project (*i.e.*, `_quarto.yml`) to be able to set `output-dir`.

```{.yaml filename=".github/workflows/deploy.yml"}
name: Deploy

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: read

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: 
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
        with:
          version: pre-release
      # Add any additional steps as needed, such as installing dependencies
      - name: Build
        shell: bash
        run: |
          [ ! -f _quarto.yml ] && echo -e "project:\n  output-dir: docs" > _quarto.yml
          if grep -q "output-dir: docs" _quarto.yml; then
            quarto render
          else
            quarto render --output-dir docs
          fi
      - name: Deploy
        shell: bash
        run: |
          git config --local user.name github-actions[bot]
          git config --local user.email 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
          git add docs || echo "No changes."
          git commit -m "ci: quarto render" || echo "No changes."
          git push origin || echo "No changes."
```

##### Deploying From the Root (*e.g.*, `gh-pages` Branch)

Using the root of the `gh-pages` branch as the source for GitHub Pages.

::: {.callout-tip}
This method offers an advantage over `quarto publish gh-pages` as it does not necessitate a local run to create the `gh-pages` branch beforehand.  
Additionally, it provides some insight into the processes that occur behind the scenes when using `quarto publish gh-pages`, thus when using the [Quarto Publish GitHub Action](#quarto-publish-github-action).
:::

```{.yaml filename=".github/workflows/deploy.yml"}
name: Deploy

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: read

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: 
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
        with:
          version: pre-release
      # Add any additional steps as needed, such as installing dependencies
      - name: Build
        shell: bash
        run: |
          [ ! -f _quarto.yml ] && echo -e "project:\n  output-dir: _site" > _quarto.yml
          if grep -q "output-dir: _site" _quarto.yml; then
            quarto render
          else
            quarto render --output-dir _site
          fi
      - name: Deploy
        shell: bash
        env:
          GH_PAGES: gh-pages
        run: |
          git config --local user.name github-actions[bot]
          git config --local user.email 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
          BUILD_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
          mv _site "${BUILD_DIR}/quarto-output"
          if git ls-remote --exit-code origin "${GH_PAGES}"; then
            git fetch origin "${GH_PAGES}"
            git checkout origin/"${GH_PAGES}"
          else
            git checkout --orphan "${GH_PAGES}"
            git rm -rf .
          fi
          mv ${BUILD_DIR}/quarto-output/* .
          git add . || echo "No changes."
          git commit --allow-empty -m "ci: quarto render" || echo "No changes."
          git push origin "${GH_PAGES}" || echo "No changes."
```

#### GitHub Actions

For more sophisticated workflows, you have the option to customise the build process, thus eliminating the need to set up the `gh-pages` or `docs` folder.
This approach is particularly advantageous as it ensures that the source repository remains uncluttered, maintaining a clear separation between the source code and the build/deploy process and environment.

```{.yaml filename=".github/workflows/deploy.yml"}
name: Deploy

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: read

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
        with:
          version: pre-release
      - name: Build
        shell: bash
        run: |
          [ ! -f _quarto.yml ] && echo -e "project:\n  output-dir: _site" > _quarto.yml
          if grep -q "output-dir: _site" _quarto.yml; then
            quarto render
          else
            quarto render --output-dir _site
          fi
      - name: Configure GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - name: Upload Pages Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: "_site"
      - name: Deploy
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

::: {.callout-note}
The workflow above utilises `_site` as the output directory, which is the default output directory for Quarto website projects. You can modify the output directory as necessary, provided it aligns with the `Upload Pages Artifact` step.

### Keeping Your GitHub Actions Workflow Up-to-Date

GitHub Actions workflows are versioned, and new versions are released periodically.
To ensure your workflows are up-to-date, you can use Dependabot to automatically create pull requests when new versions of your dependencies are available.

```{.yaml filename=".github/dependabot.yml"}
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
````

This configuration file instructs Dependabot to check for updates to GitHub Actions workflows weekly.

For more information on Dependabot, see the [Dependabot documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates).

## Conclusion

By following these methods, you'll be able to publish your Quarto projects to GitHub Pages efficiently.  
Choose the approach that best suits your needs and workflow.

Happy publishing!
