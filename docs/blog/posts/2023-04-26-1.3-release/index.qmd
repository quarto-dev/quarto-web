We are happy to announce that Quarto 1.3 has been released. You can grab the current release from <https://quarto.org/docs/download/>.

If you are ever wondering which version of Quarto you are using, a quick way to check on the command line is:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto --version
```

We've previously blogged about some of the features of this release that we were most excited about, but let's highlight them again.

## Code Annotation

You can now add line-based annotations to your code blocks using special code comments along with an ordered list. Code annotations work across many formats, and are interactive in HTML-based formats.

![Code Annotation in an HTML document](../2023-03-13-code-annotation/annotation.png){fig-alt="Screenshot a code chunk with annotations. Annotations appear in the code chunk as numbers within circles, and repeat below the code chunk along with the text content of the annotations."}

To learn more, check out the [Code Annotation](/docs/authoring/code-annotation.qmd) documentation.

## Multi-format Publishing

HTML pages (either standalone or in a website) now automatically include links to other formats specified in the document front matter. For example, the following document front matter:

``` yaml
title: Sample Page
author: Norah Jones
date: last-modified
toc: true
format: 
  html: default
  ipynb: default
```

Results in an HTML page that includes a link to the additional notebook format in the right margin below the table of contents:

![An HTML document with a link to another format](../../../output-formats/images/other-format.png){.border fig-alt="Screenshot of an HTML page that includes a link to the Jupyter format below the table of contents under the heading Other Formats."}

Find out more in the documentation on [Including Other Formats](/docs/output-formats/html-multi-format.qmd).

## Jupyter Cell Embedding

Easily include the output of an external Jupyter notebook in a Quarto document with the `embed` shortcode. Provide the path to a Jupyter Notebook and a cell identifier and the output will be included in your document along with a link back to the source Notebook.

![A plot embedded in a document from a Jupyter Notebook](../2023-03-17-jupyter-cell-embedding/embed.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of a Quarto page that includes a plot, below the plot is the phrase Source: penguins.ipynb."}

Learn more about the embed shortcode in [Embedding Jupyter Notebook Cells](/docs/authoring/notebook-embed.qmd) in the docs.

## Confluence Publishing

[Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) is a publishing platform for supporting team collaboration. Quarto now provides support for publishing individual documents, as well as projects composed of multiple documents, into [Confluence Spaces](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/use-spaces-to-organize-your-work/).

::: {layout="[800,969]"}
![A Quarto Project](../../../publishing/images/confluence-project.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of a Quarto project in VS Code. On the left in the Explorer, the project folder is called 'Guide-site', and contains folders 'authoring', and 'computation', along with some other files. A document from the folder 'python' inside the folder 'computations' with the title 'Using Python - site' is open in the Source Pane. "}

![Published to Confluence](../../../publishing/images/confluence-site.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of Space in Confluence. On the left in the Sdiebar under Pages is a page called 'Guide-site'. Nested under this page are pages called 'authoring', and 'computation', along with some other pages.
