Quarto 1.8 is available! You can get the current release from the [download page](/docs/download/index.qmd).

Quarto 1.8 improves support for light and dark brand colors and logos, brand extensions for sharing brands across Quarto projects, HTML accessibility checks powered by Axe-core, and access to more information about execution context from your code cells.
You can read about these improvements and some other highlights below. You can find all the changes in this version in the [Release Notes](/docs/download/changelog/1.8/).

## Dark and light colors and logos in brand

You can now specify `light` and `dark` versions of any colors or logo in a brand specification:

```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
color:
  foreground:
    light: "#333333"
    dark: "#EEEEEE"
  background:
    light: "#EEEEEE"
    dark: "#333333"
logos:
  medium:
    light: logo.png
    dark: logo-white.png         
```

This works in `_brand.yml` files as well as `brand` specified directly in document metadata. 
You can now also present in dark mode by specifying `brand-mode: dark` in your `format: revealjs`  presentations.

Read more in the updated [Guide > Brand](/docs/authoring/brand.qmd):

- [Light and dark colors](/docs/authoring/brand.qmd#light-and-dark-colors)
- [Light and dark logos](/docs/authoring/brand.qmd#light-and-dark-logos)
- [Brand mode](/docs/authoring/brand.qmd#brand-mode)

## Brand extensions

You can now share brand definitions and assets across Quarto projects with a brand extension.

Get started with:

```{.default filename="Terminal"}
quarto create extension brand
```

Read more in the [Extensions > Brand](/docs/extensions/brand.qmd), and keep an eye out for other ways to reuse and share your brand in future releases.

## Accessibility checks for HTML

You can add accessibility checks using the [Axe-core engine](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) to HTML documents (`format`: `html`, `revealjs` and `dashboard`) with the new `axe` option.

For example, you can get a summary of violations right in your document preview:

::: {.light-content}
![A rendered webpage with an accessibility violation warning](/docs/output-formats/images/axe-violation.png){.border fig-alt="A webpage with a box in the bottom left that warns 'Serious: Ensure the contrast between foreground and background colors meets WCAG 2 AA minimum contrast ratio thresholds'."}
:::

::: {.dark-content}
![A rendered webpage with an accessibility violation warning](/docs/output-formats/images/axe-violation.png){.border .autodark fig-alt="A webpage with a box in the bottom left that warns 'Serious: Ensure the contrast between foreground and background colors meets WCAG 2 AA minimum contrast ratio thresholds'."}
:::

Read about your options in [HTML Accessibility Checks](/docs/output-formats/html-accessibility.qmd)

We know accessability is a big concern for many of our users, and more improvements will be coming in future releases. 

## Accessing execution information

Quarto sets the `QUARTO_EXECUTE_INFO` environment variable, which allows you to access information about execution context from code cells.

Read the JSON file located at `QUARTO_EXECUTE_INFO` and access properties such as `document-path`, `format`, `metadata` and more:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## R

```{.r}
library(jsonlite)
execute_info <- read_json(Sys.getenv("QUARTO_EXECUTE_INFO"))
execute_info$`document-path`
```

## Python

```{.python}
import json
import os

with open(os.getenv("QUARTO_EXECUTE_INFO")) as f:
    execute_info = json.load(f)
execute_info["document-path"]
```

## Julia

```{.julia}
using JSON

execute_info = JSON.parsefile(ENV["QUARTO_EXECUTE_INFO"])
execute_info["document-path"]
```

:::



## Other Highlights

-  Access [metadata](/docs/extensions/lua-api.qmd#metadata-access) and [variables](/docs/extensions/lua-api.qmd#variables-access) in filters and shortcodes: Use the new `quarto.variables.get()` and `quarto.metadata.get()` APIs.

- The default LaTeX engine is now `lualatex`.

Dependency updates:

- `mermaidjs` updated to 11.6.0.
- Bootstrap icons updated to v1.13.1
- `QuartoNotebookRunner` in `julia` engine updated to 0.17.3
