Quarto 1.8 is available! You can get the current release from the [download page](/docs/download/index.qmd).

Quarto 1.8 has improvements 
You can read about these improvements and some other highlights below. You can find all the changes in this version in the [Release Notes](/docs/download/changelog/1.8/).

## Dark and light colors and logos in brand

You can now specify `light` and `dark` versions of any colors or logo in a brand specification:

```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
color:
  foreground:
    light: "#333333"
    dark: "#EEEEEE"
  background:
    light: "#EEEEEE"
    dark: "#333333"
logos:
  medium:
    light: logo.png
    dark: logo-white.png         
```

This works in `_brand.yml` files as well as `brand` specified directly in document metadata. 
You can now also present in dark mode by specifying `brand-mode: dark` in your `format: revealjs`  presentations.
