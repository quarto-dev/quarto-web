Callouts are an excellent way to draw extra attention to certain concepts, or to more clearly indicate that certain content is supplemental or applicable to only some scenarios.

## Callout Basics

There are five different types of callouts available.

-   note
-   tip
-   important
-   caution
-   warning

The color and icon will be different depending upon the type that you select.

## Syntax

Create callouts in markdown using the following syntax (note that the first markdown heading used within the callout is used as the callout heading):

``` markdown
:::{.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
