Quarto 1.6 has been officially released! You can get the current release from the [download page](/docs/download/index.qmd).

We are particularly excited about:

-   Support for **brand.yml**---a single file that defines your organization's branding and style preferences across formats.

-   RevealJS updates, including the new navigation features: scroll mode and jump to slide.

-   The `contents` shortcode for reordering your content.

-   `landscape` blocks for placing content on a landscape page.

-   Improvements in how you can specify subpanels of cross-references from code blocks.

You can read about these new features and a couple of breaking changes in the sections below. You can find all the changes in this version in the [Release Notes](/docs/download/changelog/1.6/).

## Cross-format theming with **brand.yml**

[**brand.yml**](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/) is a Posit project outside Quarto that defines brand information using a simple YAML file. Quarto is a flagship adopter of **brand.yml** and supports brand-themed output for `html`, `dashboard`, `typst` and `revealjs` formats.

{{< include /docs/authoring/_brand-example.qmd >}}

Get started by reading the Quarto [Guide to Brand](/docs/authoring/brand.qmd).

## RevealJS update

Quarto v1.6 updates RevealJS to v5.1.0. With the update comes two notable features:

[**Jump to Slide**](/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.qmd#jump-to-slide): Quickly navigate to a slide. Press {{< kbd G >}} to activate, type a slide number or ID, and hit Enter/Return.

[**Scroll Mode**](/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.qmd#scroll-view): Scroll rather than click to advance slides. Press {{< kbd R >}}, add `?view=scroll` to your URL, or use the Navigation menu to activate. Automatically activated on small screens.

## Contents shortcode

The `contents` shortcode lets you compose content in one location in your document and then display it in another. For example, you might use a code cell to generate a plot:

```` markdown
```{{python}}
#| echo: false
#| label: a-cell
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,2,3])
```
````

Then use the `contents` shortcode to display that plot in a callout by referencing its label, `a-cell`:

``` {.markdown shortcodes="false"}
::: callout-note
## Note the following plot

{{< contents a-cell >}}

:::
```

Find all the details on our guide page on the [contents shortcode](/docs/authoring/contents.qmd).

## Landscape mode

In `pdf`, `docx,` and `typst` formats, you can now put content on a landscape page by placing it inside a [`landscape` block](/docs/authoring/article-layout.html#landscape-mode):

``` markdown
::: {.landscape}

This will appear in landscape.

:::
```

## Cross-reference improvements

It should now be easier to get Quarto to recognize subfloats (subtables, subfigures, etc) when they're emitted by code cells. If the `subcap` attribute of a code cell has as many entries as the number of outputs from your code cell, Quarto knows to accept those as subfloats. See [#10328](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10328){.external} for details.

Minimal example:

```{{{r}}}
#| label: tbl-example
#| tbl-cap: I want these images to be interpreted as Tables.
#| tbl-subcap:
#|   - This is the subcaption for the first subtable
#|   - This is the subcaption for the second subtable
plot(1:10)
plot(11:20)
```

![The result of executing the above code cell in HTML format](./subcells-and-subfloats.png){.border fig-alt="Screenshot of a document showing two plots with an overall caption labelled 'Table 1', and each plot with a caption starting '(a)' and '(b)' respectively."}

## Breaking Changes

We try very hard to keep Quarto backward compatible. However, in this release, there are a couple of breaking changes due to upstream dependencies. You may be affected if:

-   **You have TypeScript files (`*.ts`) that you use either with pre- or post-render scripts, or with `quarto run` files that import Deno standard libraries.**

    The import syntax has changed. Please see [Deno Scripts](/docs/projects/scripts.html#deno-scripts) for the necessary changes.

-   **You override the LaTeX `graphics.tex` partial, or you have a completely custom LaTeX template that doesn't use the `graphics.tex` partial.**

    A Pandoc change means some images are now wrapped in `\pandocbounded`. Consequently, your `graphics.tex` partial, or your template, needs to define `\pandocbounded`. You can look at our [source code for `graphics.tex`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/pdf/pandoc/graphics.tex){.external} to see the necessary changes and read more about the upstream change in [Pandoc commit 26b25a4](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/commit/26b25a4428815b04c255e33e95ee86ca7b6ee30e){.external}.
