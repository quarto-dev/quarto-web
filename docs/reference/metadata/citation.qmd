title: "Citation Metadata"

You can provide citation data for Quarto documents in the document front matter. The citation options are based upon the [Citation Style Language (CSL) specification for items](https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html), but as YAML (rather than XML).

``` yaml
---
citation:
  type: article-journal
  container-title: ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems
  volume: 21
  issue: 2
  issued: 2022-03
  issn: 1539-9087
  doi: 10.1145/3514174
---
```

To customize the identifier of the citation:

``` yaml
---
citation:
  type: article-journal
  id: lastname2022

```
