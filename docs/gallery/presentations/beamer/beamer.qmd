## Sheena Easton and Game Theory

Sheena Easton describes the following scenario for her baby:

1.  Takes the morning train
2.  Works from nine 'til five
3.  Takes another train home again
4.  Finds Sheena Easton waiting for him

## A Total Conflict Game Between Sheena Easton and Her Baby

|                        | Stays Home    | Goes to Work  |
|------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Baby Home Again**    | -100, **100** | **100**, 0    |
| **Baby Stays at Work** | **50**, 0     | -100, **100** |

Sheena Easton and her baby are playing a **zero-sum (total conflict) game**.

-   Akin to Holmes-Moriarty game (see: von Neumann and Morgenstern)
-   Solution: **mixed strategy**

## Rick Astley's Re-election Platform

Rick Astley's campaign promises:

-   Never gonna give you up.
-   Never gonna let you down.
-   Never gonna run around and desert you.
-   Never gonna make you cry.
-   Never gonna say goodbye.
-   Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

Are these promises (if credible) sufficient to secure re-election?

## Rick Astley and Median Voter Theorem

Whereas these pledges conform to the preferences of the **median voter**, we expect Congressman Astley to secure re-election.

## Caribbean Queen and Operation Urgent Fury

Billy Ocean released "Caribbean Queen" in 1984.

-   Emphasized sharing the same dream
-   Hearts beating as one

"Caribbean Queen" is about the poor execution of Operation Urgent Fury.

-   Echoed JCS chairman David Jones' frustrations with military establishment.

Billy Ocean is advocating for what became the Goldwater-Nichols Act.

-   Wanted to take advantage of **economies of scale**, resolve **coordination problems** in U.S. military.

## The Good Day Hypothesis

We know the following about Ice Cube's day.

1.  The Lakers beat the Supersonics.
2.  No helicopter looked for a murder.
3.  Consumed Fatburger at 2 a.m.
4.  Goodyear blimp: "Ice Cube's a pimp."

## The Good Day Hypothesis

This leads to two different hypotheses:

-   $H_0$: Ice Cube's day is statistically indistinguishable from a typical day.
-   $H_1$: Ice Cube is having a good (i.e. greater than average) day.

These hypotheses are tested using archival data of Ice Cube's life.
