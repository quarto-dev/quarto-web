There are 12 built-in themes provided for Reveal presentations (you can also create your own themes). The `default` and `dark` themes use fairly classic typography and color schemes and are a good place to start.

The `default` theme is used automatically --- use the `theme` option to switch to an alternate theme. For example

```yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs: 
    theme: dark
---
```

Here is the full list of available themes:

-   `beige`
-   `blood`
-   `dark`
-   `default`
-   `dracula`
-   `league`
-   `moon`
-   `night`
-   `serif`
-   `simple`
-   `sky`
-   `solarized`
