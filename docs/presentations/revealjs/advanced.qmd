## Title Slide

The main title slide is the first slide of the presentation, and its content is generated based on a variety document options (title, subtitle, date, author, institute, etc.). 

### Custom Background

If you want to provide a custom background for the title slide, then do the following:

1. Use the `title-slide-attributes` key to provide background options.
2. Within this key, specify any of the supported [slide background options](index.qmd#slide-backgrounds),  but with `data-` prepended to them. 

For example:

```yaml
---
title: My Slide Show
title-slide-attributes:
  data-background-image: /path/to/title_image.png
  data-background-size: contain
  data-background-opacity: "0.5"
---
```

### Custom Template

You can replace the default title slide entirely with your own template. To do this, specify a `title-slide.html` [template partial](/docs/journals/templates.qmd#template-partials). For example:

```yaml
title: My Slide Show
format:
  revealjs:
    template-partials:
      - title-slide.html
```

Quarto natively supports a title slide which improves the handling of authors and affiliations. While it is backward compatible with `author` and `institute`, we now recommend that you use standard [author metadata](/docs/authoring/front-matter.qmd#authors-and-affiliations). To provide your own partial for `title-slide.html`, you can start from the source code for this [fancier title slide template](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/revealjs/pandoc/title-fancy/title-slide.html). Customize this template as required, then save the results to `title-slide.html` alongside your presentation. 

If you prefer pandoc's default title slide you can opt-in using `title-slide-style: pandoc` in your YAML --- this uses this [simpler title slide template partial](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/revealjs/pandoc/title-slide.html). However, this simpler partial does not leverage our improved handling for [Authors & Affiliations](/docs/journals/authors.qmd), so we recommend using the fancy one as a starter for custom title slides. 

### Centering {#sec-revealjs-title-center}

By default, the title slide is centered while all slides are top aligned (i.e. `center: false`). You can prevent the title slide centering by setting `center-title-slide` options: 

```yaml
title: My Slide Show
format:
  revealjs:
    center-title-slide: false
```

If `center: true` is set, `center-title-slide` will be ignored. There is currently no way to have content slide centered and title slides top aligned. For slide content centering, see @sec-revealjs-slide-center.

## Slide Transitions

Reveal supports a number of animated transition effects for both slide changes and slide background changes. By default no transitions are used, however you can enable them either globally or per-slide using the options described below.

Here are the available transition types:

| Transition | Description                                                            |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `none`     | No transition (switch instantly)                                       |
| `fade`     | Cross fade                                                             |
| `slide`    | Slide horizontally                                                     |
| `convex`   | Slide at a convex angle                                                |
| `concave`  | Slide at a concave angle                                               |
| `zoom`     | Scale the incoming slide so it grows in from the center of the screen. |

Here's how you would set the global transition style for both slides and backgrounds:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    transition: slide
    background-transition: fade
---
```

You can also specify the `transition-speed` as `default`, `fast`, or `slow`:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    transition: slide
    transition-speed: fast
---
```

You can also specify the `transition` and/or `transition-speed` for an individual slide:

``` markdown
## Slide Title {transition="fade" transition-speed="fast"}
```

You can also specify separate in and out transitions, for example:

``` markdown
## Slide Title {transition="fade-in slide-out"}
```

## Slide Visibility

You can hide a slide by adding the `visibility="hidden"` attribute to the slide heading. For example:

``` markdown
## Slide Title {visibility="hidden"}
```

### Uncounted Slides

When preparing a presentation it can sometimes be helpful to prepare optional slides that you may or may not have time to show. This is easily done by appending a few slides at the end of the presentation, however this means that the Reveal progress bar and slide numbering will hint that there are additional slides.

To "hide" those slides from the numbering system you can use `visibility="uncounted"`. For example:

``` markdown
## Slide 1

## Slide 2

## Slide 3 {visibility="uncounted"}
```

## Presentation Size

All presentations have a "normal" size, that is, the resolution at which they are authored. This default "normal" size is 1050 x 700, which is used to match as nearly as possible the aspect ratio of most laptops.

Reveal will automatically scale presentations uniformly based on the normal size to ensure that everything fits on any given display or viewport without changing the aspect ratio or layout of your content.

You can change the slide size, the margin around content, as well as set limits on content scaling using the following options:

| Option      | Description                                                                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `width`     | Normal width (defaults to 1050)                                                          |
| `height`    | Normal height (defaults to 700)                                                          |
| `margin`    | Factor of the display size that should remain empty around the content (defaults to 0.1) |
| `min-scale` | Smallest possible scale to apply to content (defaults to 0.2)                            |
| `max-scale` | Largest possible scale to apply to content (defaults to 2.0)                             |

## Absolute Position

The `absolute` class lets you position elements at arbitrary positions on a slide. These elements have CSS `position: absolute` and can be placed relative to the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and/or `right` edges of the slide.

For example, here we add the `.absolute` class to three images and give them each a distinct position on the slide (note that we use also `width` and `height` to control their dimensions):

``` {.markdown .reveal-demo code-preview="demo/mini/absolute.qmd"}
![](image1.png){.absolute top=200 left=0 width="350" height="300"}

![](image2.png){.absolute top=50 right=50 width="450" height="250"}

![](image3.png){.absolute bottom=0 right=50 width="300" height="300"}
```

The following attributes can be used with `absolute`. All of these values can be specified in CSS units (e.g. `px`, `em`, etc.). If a number with no units is specified (as in the above example) then pixels are assumed.

| Attribute | Description                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| `width`   | Width of element              |
| `height`  | Height of element             |
| `top`     | Distance from top of slide    |
| `left`    | Distance from left of slide   |
| `bottom`  | Distance from bottom of slide |
| `right`   | Distance from right of slide  |

Note that default size of presentation slides is 1050 x 700. See [Presentation Size] for details on customizing this.

## Layout Helpers

Reveal provides some helper classes for controlling the layout of content.

### Stack Layout

The `r-stack` layout class lets you center and place multiple elements on top of each other. This is intended to be used together with [fragments] to incrementally reveal elements.

For example, here we create a div with the `.r-stack` class and then include 3 images (each of which uses `.fragment` so they display incrementally):

``` {.markdown .reveal-demo code-preview="demo/mini/stack.qmd"}
::: {.r-stack}
![](image1.png){.fragment width="450" height="300"}

![](image2.png){.fragment width="300" height="450"}

![](image3.png){.fragment width="400" height="400"}
:::
```

### Fit Text

The `r-fit-text` class makes text as large as possible without overflowing the slide. This is great when you want BIG text without having to manually find the right font size. For example:

``` markdown
::: {.r-fit-text}
Big Text
:::
```

### Center {#sec-revealjs-slide-center}

The `center` class when applied to a slide, will vertically center the slide content by adding the appropriate spacing at the top of the slide. Vertical distances between elements will not be modified. For example:

``` markdown
## This will be centered {.center}

This text is moved as well
```

For controlling title slide centering, see @sec-revealjs-title-center.

### Stretch

The `r-stretch` layout helper lets you resize an element, like an image or video, to cover the remaining vertical space in a slide. For example, here the image will automatically be resized to fit space remaining outside of the slide title and text before and after it:

``` markdown
## Slide Title

Here is an image:

![](image.png){.r-stretch}

Some text after the image.
```

For slides that contain only a single top-level image, the `.r-stretch` class is automatically applied to the image. You can disable this behavior by setting the `auto-stretch: false` option:

``` yaml
format:
  revealjs:
    auto-stretch: false
```

You can also disable auto-stretch for an individual slide by adding the `.nostretch` class:

``` markdown
## Slide Title {.nostretch}
```

Or apply `.nostretch` directly to an individual image:

```markdown
![](image.png){.nostretch fig-align="center" width="800px"}
```

`auto-stretch` will only apply to non-nested images, which means an image in a feature block (e.g fragments, layout panel, columns, ... ) or a custom Div will be ignored. For custom Divs, you can opt-in to `auto-stretch` behavior by adding the class `.r-stretch` to the outer div. 

{{< include _callout-auto-stretch-scrollable.qmd >}}

## Auto Animate

Revealjs can automatically animate elements across slides. All you need to do is add the `auto-animate` attribute to two adjacent slides and Auto-Animate will animate all matching elements between the two.

Here's a simple example to give you a better idea of how it can be used. Note that the slides don't have titles in this example (rather just the `auto-animate` attribute) however they could also include a title.

``` {.markdown .reveal-demo code-preview="demo/mini/auto-animate.qmd"}
## {auto-animate=true}

::: {style="margin-top: 100px;"}
Animating content
:::

## {auto-animate=true}

::: {style="margin-top: 200px; font-size: 3em; color: red;"}
Animating content
:::
```

This example uses the `margin-top` property to move the element but internally Reveal will use a CSS transform to ensure smooth movement. This same approach to animation works with most animatable CSS properties meaning you can transition things like `position`, `font-size`, `line-height`, `color`, `background-color`, `padding` and `margin`.

### Code Animations

You can also animate between code blocks to show changes in code. For example:

```` {.markdown .reveal-demo code-preview="demo/mini/auto-animate-code.qmd"}
## {auto-animate="true"}

```r
# Fill in the spot we created for a plot
output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
  # Render a barplot
})
```

## {auto-animate=true}

```r
# Fill in the spot we created for a plot
output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
  # Render a barplot
  barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region]*1000, 
          main=input$region,
          ylab="Number of Telephones",
          xlab="Year")
})
```
````

### Movement Animations

Animations are not limited to changes in style. Auto-Animate can also be used to automatically move elements into their new position as content is added, removed or rearranged on a slide. All without a single line of inline CSS. For example, here the delta between the content on two slides is implicitly animated:

``` {.markdown .reveal-demo code-preview="demo/mini/auto-animate-movement.qmd"}
## {auto-animate=true}

Animation

## {auto-animate=true}

Implicit

Animation
```

### Element Matching

When you navigate between two auto-animated slides we'll do our best to automatically find matching elements in the two slides. For text, we consider it a match if both the text contents and node type are identical. For images, videos and iframes we compare the `src` attribute. We also take into account the order in which the element appears in the DOM.

In situations where automatic matching is not feasible you can give the objects that you want to animate between a matching `data-id` attribute. We prioritize matching `data-id` values above our automatic matching.

Here's an example where we've given several blocks a matching ID since automatic matching has no content to go on. This example also makes use of some additional animation attributes (`auto-animate-easing` and `auto-animate-delay`), which we'll describe in the next section.

``` {.markdown .reveal-demo code-preview="demo/mini/auto-animate-stack.qmd"}
## {auto-animate=true auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"}

::: {.r-hstack}
::: {data-id="box1" auto-animate-delay="0" style="background: #2780e3; width: 200px; height: 150px; margin: 10px;"}
:::

::: {data-id="box2" auto-animate-delay="0.1" style="background: #3fb618; width: 200px; height: 150px; margin: 10px;"}
:::

::: {data-id="box3" auto-animate-delay="0.2" style="background: #e83e8c; width: 200px; height: 150px; margin: 10px;"}
:::
:::

## {auto-animate=true auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"}

::: {.r-stack}
::: {data-id="box1" style="background: #2780e3; width: 350px; height: 350px; border-radius: 200px;"}
:::

::: {data-id="box2" style="background: #3fb618; width: 250px; height: 250px; border-radius: 200px;"}
:::

::: {data-id="box3" style="background: #e83e8c; width: 150px; height: 150px; border-radius: 200px;"}
:::
:::
```

### Animation Settings

You can override specific animation settings such as easing and duration either for the whole presentation, per-slide or individually for each animated element. The following configuration attributes can be used to change the settings for a specific slide or element:

| **Attribute**            | **Default** | **Description**                                                                                                                |
|:-------------------------|:-----------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `auto-animate-easing`    |    ease     | A CSS [easing function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function).                                     |
| `auto-animate-unmatched` |    true     | Determines whether elements with no matching auto-animate target should fade in. Set to `false` to make them appear instantly. |
| `auto-animate-duration`  |     1.0     | Animation duration in seconds.                                                                                                 |
| `auto-animate-delay`     |      0      | Animation delay in seconds (can only be set for specific elements, not at the slide level).                                    |
| `auto-animate-id`        |  *absent*   | An id tying auto-animate slides together.                                                                                      |
| `auto-animate-restart`   |  *absent*   | Breaks apart two adjacent auto-animate slides (even with the same id).                                                         |

You can override the global defaults for easing, unmatched, and duration as follows:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Slide"
format:
  revealjs:
    auto-animate-easing: ease-in-out
    auto-animate-unmatched: false
    auto-animate-duration: 0.8
---
```

## Fragments {data-link="fragments"}

Fragments are used to highlight or incrementally reveal individual elements on a slide. Every element with the class `fragment` will be stepped through before moving on to the next slide.

Note that fragments as discussed here are a relatively advanced form of incremental content display---see [Incremental Lists](index.qmd#incremental-lists) for documentation on creating incremental bullet lists and inserting content pauses in slides.

The default fragment style is to start out invisible and fade in. This style can be changed by appending a different class to the fragment. For example:

``` {.markdown .reveal-demo code-preview="demo/mini/fragments.qmd"}
::: {.fragment}
Fade in
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
Fade out
:::

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
Highlight red
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
Fade in, then out
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Slide up while fading in
:::
```

### Fragment Classes

Here are all of the available fragment classes:

| **Name**                  | **Effect**                                          |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| `fade-out`                | Start visible, fade out                             |
| `fade-up`                 | Slide up while fading in                            |
| `fade-down`               | Slide down while fading in                          |
| `fade-left`               | Slide left while fading in                          |
| `fade-right`              | Slide right while fading in                         |
| `fade-in-then-out`        | Fades in, then out on the next step                 |
| `fade-in-then-semi-out`   | Fades in, then out to 50% on the next step          |
| `grow`                    | Scale up                                            |
| `semi-fade-out`           | Fade out to 50%                                     |
| `shrink`                  | Scale down                                          |
| `strike`                  | Strike through                                      |
| `highlight-red`           | Turn text red                                       |
| `highlight-green`         | Turn text green                                     |
| `highlight-blue`          | Turn text blue                                      |
| `highlight-current-red`   | Turn text red, then back to original on next step   |
| `highlight-current-green` | Turn text green, then back to original on next step |
| `highlight-current-blue`  | Turn text blue, then back to original on next step  |

### Nested Fragments

Multiple fragments can be applied to the same element sequentially by wrapping it. The following example will fade in the text on the first step, turn it red on the second and partially fade out on the third:

``` {.markdown .reveal-demo code-preview="demo/mini/fragments-nested.qmd"}
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
Fade in > Turn red > Semi fade out
:::
:::
:::
```

### Fragment Order

By default fragments will be stepped through in the order that they appear in the DOM. This display order can be changed using the `fragment-index` attribute. Note that multiple elements can appear at the same index:

``` markdown
::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
Appears last
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
Appears first
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
Appears second
:::
```

### Custom Fragments

Custom effects can be created by specifying CSS styles for `.fragment.effectname` and `.fragment.effectname.visible`. The `visible` class is applied to each fragment as they are navigated through during the presentation. A `custom` class can be added to each fragment to tell reveal.js to avoid applying its default fade-in fragment styles.

For example, the following defines a fragment style where elements are initially blurred but become focused when stepped through.

``` {.markdown .reveal-demo code-preview="demo/mini/fragments-custom.qmd"}
::: {.fragment .custom .blur}
First item to be unblurred
:::

::: {.fragment .custom .blur}
Second one to be revealed
:::
```

with this CSS for the style associated with `blur` class.
````css
.reveal .slides section .fragment.blur {
  filter: blur(5px);
}

.reveal .slides section .fragment.blur.visible {
  filter: none
}
````

## Parallax Background

If you want to use a parallax scrolling background, add the `parallax-background-image` and `parallax-background-size` options. For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
     parallax-background-image: background.png
     parallax-background-size: "2100px 900px"
     parallax-background-horizontal: 200
     parallax-background-vertical: 50
---
```

Note that the `parallax-background-horizontal` and `parallax-background-vertical` options are not required (the defaults shown above will be used if they are not specified).

## Vertical Slides

Reveal uses classic linear slide navigation by default. If you wish you can also configure slide navigation to nest multiple slides within a single top-level slide to create a vertical stack.

Use the `navigation-mode` option to fine tune Reveal navigation behavior:

| Navigation Mode | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `linear`        | Left/right arrows keys step through all slides (both horizontal and vertical).                                                                                            |
| `vertical`      | Left/right arrow keys step between horizontal slides. Up/down arrow keys step between vertical slides. Space key steps through all slides (both horizontal and vertical). |
| `grid`          | When enabled, stepping left/right from a vertical stack to an adjacent vertical stack will land you at the same vertical index.                                           |

If you use `vertical` or `grid` navigation, you should structure your slides using level 1 headings for the horizontal axis and level 2 headings for the vertical axis. For example:

``` markdown
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    navigation-mode: vertical
---

# Slide 1

## Slide 1.1

## Slide 1.2

# Slide 2

## Slide 2.1

## Slide 2.2
```

### Slide Controls

When you enable `vertical` or `grid` navigation, controls will appear to provide a visual cue to where you are in the presentation (e.g. if there are vertical slides below you'll see a down control).

By default these controls appear at the edges of the presentation, you can position them in the bottom right corner using the `controls-layout` option. You can also provide an extra visual cue to viewers that the controls are available using the `controls-tutorial` option. For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format: 
  revealjs:
    navigation-mode: vertical
    controls-layout: bottom-right
    controls-tutorial: true
---
```

Note that using `controls-layout: bottom-right` isn't compatible with including a `logo` (as the logo appears in the bottom right corner as well).

You can also disable the controls entirely with `controls: false`.

While vertical slides do provide some additional flexibility over the traditional linear model, they are in practice very confusing for end users (mostly because they are so unexpected). Users will often skip the vertical content because they simply don't know it's there.

If your content benefits from vertical orientation (e.g. you have optional drill-down content that you don't want in the main flow of the presentation), you can by all means use the vertical mode. Just know that if you distribute your slides to users they will very likely not end up viewing any of the vertical content.

## Touch Navigation

You can swipe to navigate through a presentation on any touch-enabled device. 

If you wish to disable this you can set the `touch` option to `false`:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    touch: false
    controls: true
---
```

Note that we also enable `controls` at the same time (as users on phones or tablets don't have access to a keyboard).

## Reveal Plugins

To use [Revealjs plugins](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware), you need to package them into a directory with a config file (`plugin.yml`). The config file lets Quarto know how to inject the plugin into the presentation (e.g. what scripts and/or css files to include, what the default configuration should be, etc.).

See the source code of the plugins that are built into Quarto Reveal for examples:

<https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/src/resources/formats/revealjs/plugins>

To use a plugin, just include a reference to its directory in the list of `revealjs-plugins`. For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    revealjs-plugins:
      - myplugin
---
```

Note that many of the most popular Reveal plugins are already included with the Quarto version of Reveal, so there is no need to include them separately. Built-in plugins include:

-   [Multiplex](https://github.com/reveal/multiplex)
-   [RevealMenu](https://github.com/denehyg/reveal.js-menu)
-   [RevealChalkboard](https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/chalkboard)
-   [PdfExport](https://github.com/McShelby/reveal-pdfexport)

### Example

Let's show an example with the [fullscreen](https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/fullscreen) plugin. Here are the steps to bundle this plugin to use within your Quarto HTML presentation:

1.  Create a folder with the name you want for the plugin, here we'll call it `fullscreen`.

2.  Download the plugin files into the created folder. Here the plugin only have a JS file called `plugin.js` that you can find [on the repo *rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/master/fullscreen/plugin.js). You can keep the name or rename it, e.g `fullscreen.js`.

3.  In that folder add a `plugin.yml` file, as in [Quarto Reveal examples](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/src/resources/formats/revealjs/plugins).

    -   `name` is a mandatory field which should be the name of the JS function the JS plugin is defining. Open the JS script you downloaded to look for it.
    -   Other fields are for the resources to be used. In our example, only a JS script so we'll use `script`

    Our `plugin.yml` would be:

    ``` yaml
    name: RevealFullscreen
    script: [fullscreen.js]
    ```

4.  Now add the plugin reference into your document YAML header, using the path of the folder your created:

    ``` yaml
    format: 
     revealjs:
       revealjs-plugins:
         - fullscreen
    ```

5.  The custom plugin will be loaded in your presentation and you can use it. The plugin *fullscreen* documentation shows an example of adding a Map fullscreen in a slide by adding an attribute on the section, and using stretch on the content. This would translate to having this slide in the `.qmd` file:

    ``` markdown
    ## {fullscreen=true}

    <iframe class="stretch" data-src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m12!1m3!1d61206.89156051744!2d-151.77366863890407!3d-16.50433878928727!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sde!4v1467468929561"></iframe>
    ```
