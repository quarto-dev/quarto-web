You can also insert a pause within a slide (keeping the content after the pause hidden) by inserting three dots separated by spaces:

```{.markdown code-preview="examples/incremental-pause.qmd"}
## Slide with a pause

content before the pause

. . .

content after the pause
```

Note this only works below headings that are creating slides (see [Creating slides](#creating-slides)).
