title: "Running Documents"

## Overview

There are a number of ways to run Shiny interactive documents:

1.  Use **Run Document** within the RStudio IDE.
2.  Use the `quarto serve` command line interface.
3.  Deploy them to a server for use by a wider audience.

We'll cover all of these scenario in depth here. Note that in order to run interactive Shiny documents you will to install the very latest version of the **rmarkdown** package (v2.10) which you can install as follows:

``` r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

## RStudio IDE

While you are developing an interactive document it will likely be most convenient to run within RStudio.

Note that you need RStudio {{< var rstudio.min_version >}} or a later version in order to run Quarto interactive documents. You can download the latest release ({{< var rstudio.current_release >}}) here <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.

Click the **Run Document** button while editing a Shiny interactive document to render and view the document within the IDE:

When you make changes, just click **Run Document** again to see them reflected in the document preview.

Two options you may want to consider enabling are **Run on Save** and **Preview in Viewer Pane** (by default previews occur in an external window). You can access these options on the editor toolbar:

## Command Line

You can also run Shiny interactive documents from the command line via `quarto serve`. For example:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto serve document.qmd
```

There are a number of options to the `serve` command to control the port and host of the document server as well as whether a browser is automatically opened for the running document. You can learn more about these options with `quarto serve help`.

If you are within an R session you can also use the **quarto** R package to run a document:

``` r
library(quarto)
quarto_serve("document.qmd")
```

## Deployment

### ShinyApps

You can publish Shiny interactive documents to the [ShinyApps](http://shinyapps.io/) hosted service. To do this you should ensure that you have:

1.  An account on ShinyApps (use the [signup form](http://shinyapps.io/) to create an account).

2.  The very latest versions of the **rsconnect** and **quarto** R packages. You can install them as follows:

    ``` r
    install.packages("rsconnect")
    install.packages("quarto")
    ```

You can then deploy your interactive document using the `quarto_publish_app()` function of the **quarto** package. You can do this as follows (working from the directory that contains your document):

``` r
library(quarto)
quarto_publish_app(server = "shinyapps.io")
```

If you are using RStudio you can also use the **Publish** button <kbd>![](../../output-formats/images/publish-button.png){width="21"}</kbd> available when working with an interactive document:

Note that you should always **Run Document** locally prior to publishing your document (as this will create the `.html` file that is served on ShinyApps.

### Hugging Face

HuggingFace Spaces provides an SDK for deploying Shiny for R applications. Learn more about using HuggingFace with Shiny for R here: <https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-shiny#shiny-for-r>.

### Posit Connect

[Posit Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) is a server product from Posit for secure sharing of applications, reports, and plots. You can publish Shiny interactive documents to Posit Connect in much the same way as described above for [ShinyApps].

First, make sure you very latest development versions of the **rsconnect** and **quarto** R packages. You can install them as follows:

``` r
install.packages("rsconnect")
install.packages("quarto")
```

Next, deploy your interactive document using the `quarto_publish_app()` function of the **quarto** package, providing the domain name or IP address of your Posit Connect installation via the `server` parameter. You can do this as follows (working from the directory that contains your document):

``` r
library(quarto)
quarto_publish_app(server = "rsc.example.com")
```

If you are using RStudio you can also use the **Publish** button <kbd>![](../../output-formats/images/publish-button.png){width="21"}</kbd> as described above in the ShinyApps documentation:

![](images/rstudio-ide-rsc-publish.png){.border width="573"}

As with ShinyApps, you should always **Run Document** locally prior to publishing your document (as this will create the `.html` file that is served by Posit Connect).
