## Caching

[Jupyter Cache](https://jupyter-cache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) enables you to cache all of the cell outputs for a notebook. If any of the cells in the notebook change then all of the cells will be re-executed.

To use Jupyter Cache you'll want to first install the `jupyter-cache` package:

::: {.list-table widths="0.26388888888889,0.66666666666667" header-rows="1"}

* * Platform
  * Command

* * Mac/Linux
  
  * ```bash {.bash filename="Terminal"}
    python3 -m pip install jupyter-cache
    ```

* * Windows
  
  * ```powershell {.powershell filename="Terminal"}
    py -m pip install jupyter-cache
    ```

:::

To enable the cache for a document, add the `cache` option. For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
format: html
execute: 
  cache: true
---
```

You can also specify caching at the project level. For example, within a project file:

``` yaml
project:
  type: website
  
format:
  html:
    theme: united
    
execute:
  cache: true
```

Note that changes within a document that aren't within code cells (e.g. markdown narrative) do not invalidate the document cache. This makes caching a very convenient option when you are working exclusively on the prose part of a document.

Jupyter Cache include a `jcache` command line utility that you can use to analyze and manage the notebook cache. See the [Jupyter Cache](https://jupyter-cache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) documentation for additional details.
