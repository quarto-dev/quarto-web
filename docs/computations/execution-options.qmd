## Output Options

There are a wide variety of options available for customizing output from executed code. All of these options can be specified either globally (in the document front-matter) or per code-block. For example, here's a modification of the Python example to specify that we don't want to "echo" the code into the output document:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
execute:
  echo: false
jupyter: python3
---
```

Note that we can override this option on a per code-block basis. For example:

```{{python}}
#| echo: true

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,2,3,4])
plt.show()
```

Code block options are included in a special comment at the top of the block (lines at the top prefaced with `#|` are considered options).

Options available for customizing output include:

::: {.list-table header-rows="1" widths="0.071090047393365,0.92890995260664"}

* * Option
  * Description

* * `eval`
  * Evaluate the code chunk (if `false`, just echos the code into the output).

* * `echo`
  * Include the source code in output

* * `output`
  * Include the results of executing the code in the output (`true`, `false`, or `asis` to indicate that the output is raw markdown and should not have any of Quarto's standard enclosing markdown).

* * `warning`
  * Include warnings in the output.

* * `error`
  * Include errors in the output (note that this implies that errors executing code will not halt processing of the document).

* * `include`
  * Catch all for preventing any output (code or results) from being included (e.g. `include: false` suppresses all output from the code block).

* * `renderings`
  * Specify rendering names for the plot or table outputs of the cell, e.g. `[light, dark]`

:::

Here's a Knitr example with some of these additional options included:

````         
---
title: "Knitr Document"
execute:
  echo: false
---

```{{r}}
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE)
```

```{{r}}
summary(airquality)
```
````

### Cell Renderings

Here is an example of using `renderings` to provide light and dark versions of a plot. Note that the number of cell outputs must match the number of renderings.

````
---
title: "Dark mode"
format: 
  html:
    theme:
      light: flatly
      dark: darkly
---

```{{r}}
#| renderings: [light, dark]
par(bg = "#FFFFFF", fg = "#000000")
plot(1:10) # Shown in `light` mode

par(bg = "#000000", fg = "#FFFFFF", col.axis = "#FFFFFF")
plot(1:10) # Shown in `dark` mode
```
````

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![light rendering](images/renderings-light-mode.png)

![dark rendering](images/renderings-dark-mode.png)

:::

The `renderings` cell option does not currently work correctly with cell cross-reference options (`label` starting with `fig-`, `tbl-`, etc.) or cell caption options (`fig-cap`, `tbl-cap`, etc.).


To combine `renderings` with crossrefs and/or captions, use the fenced div syntax:


````
---
title: "Dark mode"
format:
  html:
    theme:
      light: flatly
      dark: darkly
---

::: {#fig-caption-crossref}

```{{r}}
#| label: caption-crossref
#| renderings: [light, dark]
par(bg = "#FFFFFF", fg = "#000000")
plot(1:10) # Shown in `light` mode


par(bg = "#000000", fg = "#FFFFFF", col.axis = "#FFFFFF")
plot(1:10) # Shown in `dark` mode
```

Light and dark renderings with a caption and crossref

:::
````

Note the use of a `label` that is not a cross-reference, i.e. that does not start with one of the [cross reference types](../authoring/cross-references.qmd#overview). It is a good practice to have named cells with `label`, for debuggability and stable resource names. However, cross-reference labels that start with `fig-`, `tbl-`, etc., will not work with `renderings`.



::: callout-tip
When using the Knitr engine, you can also use any of the available native options (e.g. `collapse`, `tidy`, `comment`, etc.). See the [Knitr options documentation](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) for additional details. You can include these native options in option comment blocks as shown above, or on the same line as the `{r}` as shown in the Knitr documentation.
:::

::: callout-tip
The Knitr engine can also *conditionally* evaluate a code chunk using objects or expressions. See [Using R: Knitr Options](r.qmd#chunk-options).

## Figure Options

There are a number of ways to control the default width and height of figures generated from code. First, it's important to know that Quarto sets a default width and height for figures appropriate to the target output format. Here are the defaults (expressed in inches):

| Format                  | Default   |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| Default                 | 7 x 5     |
| HTML Slides             | 9.5 x 6.5 |
| HTML Slides (reveal.js) | 9 x 5     |
| PDF                     | 5.5 x 3.5 |
| PDF Slides (Beamer)     | 10 x 7    |
| PowerPoint              | 7.5 x 5.5 |
| MS Word, ODT, RTF       | 5 x 4     |
| EPUB                    | 5 x 4     |
| Hugo                    | 8 x 5     |

These defaults were chosen to provide attractive well proportioned figures, but feel free to experiment to see whether you prefer another default size. You can change the default sizes using the `fig-width` and `fig-height` options. For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
format: 
  html:
    fig-width: 8
    fig-height: 6
  pdf:
    fig-width: 7
    fig-height: 5
---
```

How do these sizes make their way into the engine-level defaults for generating figures? This differs by engine:

-   For the Knitr engine, these values become the default values for the `fig.width` and `fig.height` chunk options. You can override these default values via chunk level options.

-   For Python, these values are used to set the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html) `figure.figsize` rcParam (you can of course manually override these defaults for any given plot).

-   For Julia, these values are used to initialize the default figure size for the [Plots.jl](https://docs.juliaplots.org/stable/) GR backend.

    If you are using another graphics library with Jupyter and want to utilize these values, you can read them from `QUARTO_FIG_WIDTH` and `QUARTO_FIG_HEIGHT` environment variables.

::: callout-caution
When using the Jupyter engine, `fig-width` and `fig-height` are only supported if specified at the document- or project-level. 
However, when using the Knitr engine, these options are also supported as code cell options on a per-cell basis.
:::

### Caption and Alt Text

You can specify the caption and alt text for figures generated from code using the `fig-cap` and `fig-alt` options. For example, here we add these options to a Python code cell that creates a plot:

```{{python}}
#| fig-cap: "Polar axis plot"
#| fig-alt: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Inline Code

Jupyter, Knitr and OJS all support executing inline code within markdown (e.g. to allow narrative to automatically use the most up to date computations). See [Inline Code](inline-code.qmd) for details.

## Raw Output

The `output: asis` option enables you to generate raw markdown output. When `output: asis` is specified none of Quarto's standard enclosing divs will be included. For example, here we specify `output: asis` in order to generate a pair of headings:

::: panel-tabset
## Jupyter

```{{python}}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

print("# Heading 1\n")
print("## Heading 2\n")
```

## Knitr

```{{r}}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

cat("# Heading 1\n")
cat("## Heading 2\n")
```
:::

Which generates the following output:

``` default
# Heading 1

## Heading 2
```

Note that we also include the `echo: false` option to ensure that the code used to generate markdown isn't included in the final output.

If we had not specified `output: asis` the output, as seen in the intermediate markdown, would have included Quarto's `.cell-output` div:

```` default
::: {.cell-output-stdout}
```
# Heading 1

## Heading 2
  
```
:::
````

For the Jupyter engine, you can also create raw markdown output using the functions in `IPython.display`. For example:

```{{python}}
#| echo: false
radius = 10
from IPython.display import Markdown
Markdown(f"The _radius_ of the circle is **{radius}**.")
```

{{< include _knitr-options.md >}}

## Jupyter Options

### Expression Printing

When multiple expressions are present in a code cell, by default, only the last top-level expression is captured in the rendered output. For example, consider the code cell:

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
```` markdown
```{{python}}
"first"
"last"
```
````
:::

When rendered to HTML the output generated is:

``` markdown
'last'
```

This behavior corresponds to the `last_expr` setting for [Jupyter shell interactivity](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/options/terminal.html#configtrait-InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity).

You can control this behavior with the `ipynb-shell-interactivity` option. For example, to capture all top-level expressions set it to `all`:

``` yaml
---
title: All expressions
format: html
ipynb-shell-interactivity: all
---
```

Now the above code cell results in the output:

``` markdown
'first'

'last'
```

::: callout-note
## All Expressions are Printed in Dashboards

For [dashboards](/docs/dashboards/index.qmd) the default setting of `ipynb-shell-interactivity` is `all.`
:::

## Intermediates

On the way from markdown input to final output, there are some intermediate files that are created and automatically deleted at the end of rendering. You can use the following options to keep these intermediate files:

::: {.list-table widths="0.13392857142857,0.86607142857143" header-rows="1"}

* * Option
  * Description

* * `keep-md`
  * Keep the markdown file generated by executing code.

* * `keep-ipynb`
  * Keep the notebook file generated from executing code (applicable only to markdown input files)

:::

For example, here we specify that we want to keep the jupyter intermediate file after rendering:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
execute:
  keep-ipynb: true
jupyter: python3
---
```

## Fenced Echo

If you are writing a tutorial or documentation on using Quarto code blocks, you'll likely want to include the fenced code delimiter (e.g. ```` ```{python} ````) in your code output to emphasize that executable code requires that delimiter. You can do this using the `echo: fenced` option. For example, the following code block:

```{{python}}
#| echo: fenced
1 + 1
```

Will be rendered as:

```{python}
#| echo: fenced
1 + 1
```

This is especially useful when you want to demonstrate the use of cell options. For example, here we demonstrate the use of the `output` and `code-overflow` options:

```{{python}}
#| echo: fenced
#| output: false
#| code-overflow: wrap
1 + 1
```

This code block appears in the rendered document as:

```{python}
#| echo: fenced
#| output: false
#| code-overflow: wrap
1 + 1
```

Note that all YAML options will be included in the fenced code output *except for* `echo: fenced` (as that might be confusing to readers).

This behavior can also be specified at the document level if you want all of your executable code blocks to include the fenced delimiter and YAML options:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
format: html
execute:
  echo: fenced
---
```

#### Unexecuted Blocks

## Engine Binding

Earlier we said that the engine used for computations was determined automatically. You may want to customize this---for example you may want to use the Jupyter [R kernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel) rather than Knitr, or you may want to use Knitr with Python code (via [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)).

Here are the basic rules for automatic binding:

::: {.list-table header-rows="1" widths="0.048979591836735,0.95102040816327"}

* * Extension
  * Engine Binding

* * .qmd
  
  * Use Knitr engine if an `{r}` code block is discovered within the file
    
    Use Jupyter engine if *any other* executable code block (e.g. `{python}`, `{julia}`, `{bash}`, etc.) is discovered within the file. The kernel used is determined based on the language of the first executable code block discovered.
    
    Use no engine if no executable code blocks are discovered.

* * .ipynb
  * Jupyter engine

* * .Rmd
  * Knitr engine

* * .md
  * No engine (note that if an `md` document does contain executable code blocks then an error will occur)

:::

::: callout-note

## Using python and r together

If your quarto document includes both `{python}` and `{r}` code blocks, then quarto will automatically use Knitr engine and [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) R package to execute the python content.
:::

For `.qmd` files in particular, you can override the engine used via the `engine` option. For example:

``` markdown
engine: jupyter
```

``` markdown
engine: knitr
```

You can also specify that no execution engine should be used via `engine: markdown`.

The presence of the `knitr` or `jupyter` option will also override the default engine:

``` markdown
knitr: true
```

``` markdown
jupyter: python3
```

Variations with additional engine-specific options also work to override the default engine:

``` markdown
knitr:
  opts_knit:
    verbose: true
```

``` markdown
jupyter:
  kernelspec:
    display_name: Python 3
    language: python
    name: python3
```

## Shell Commands

Using shell commands (from Bash, Zsh, etc.) within Quarto computational documents differs by engine. If you are using the Jupyter engine you can use [Jupyter shell magics](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/01.05-ipython-and-shell-commands.html). For example:

```` markdown
---
title: "Using Bash"
engine: jupyter
---

```{{python}}
!echo "foo"
```
````

Note that `!` preceding `echo` is what enables a Python cell to be able to execute a shell command.

If you are using the Knitr engine you can use ```` ```{bash} ```` cells, for example:

```` markdown
---
title: "Using Bash"
engine: knitr
---

```{{bash}}
echo "foo" 
```
````

Note that the Knitr engine also supports ```` ```{python} ```` cells, enabling the combination of R, Python, and Bash in the same document
