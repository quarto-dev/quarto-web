Virtual environments provide a project-specific version of installed packages. This both helps you to faithfully reproduce your environment (e.g. if you are collaborating with a colleague or deploying to a server) as well as isolate the use of packages so that upgrading a package in one project doesn't break other projects.

There are several popular flavors of virtual environment, we will cover the following ones here:

1.  [venv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) (built into Python 3)

2.  [conda](https://towardsdatascience.com/managing-project-specific-environments-with-conda-406365a539ab) (built in to Anaconda/Miniconda)

3.  [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) (package for managing R environments)

Below we'll provide some example workflows for using these tools with Quarto. In these examples we'll assume that you are already within a project directory that contains Quarto documents (so the environment will be created as a sub-directory of the project).

We'll also cover using virtual environments with [JupyterLab](#jupyterlab), [RStudio](#rstudio), and [VS Code](#vs-code).

## Using venv {#using-venv .platform-table}

Here we'll provide a brief run through of creating a venv for a Quarto project. See the [full documentation](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) on using virtual environments with Python for additional details.

To create a new Python 3 virtual environment in the directory `env`:

+--------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Platform     | Command                                        |
+==============+================================================+
| Mac/Linux    | ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}                 |
|              | python3 -m venv env                            |
|              | ```                                            |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Windows      | ```{.powershell filename="Terminal"}           |
|              | py -m venv env                                 |
|              | ```                                            |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------+

To use the environment you need to activate it. This differs slightly depending on which platform / shell you are using:

+---------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Shell         | Command                                 |
+===============+=========================================+
| Mac/Linux     | ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}          |
|               | source env/bin/activate                 |
|               | ```                                     |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Windows\      | ```{.powershell filename="Terminal"}    |
| (Command)     | env\Scripts\activate.bat                |
|               | ```                                     |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Windows\      | ```{.powershell filename="Terminal"}    |
| (PowerShell)  | env\Scripts\Activate.ps1                |
|               | ```                                     |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------+

::: callout-note
#### PowerShell Note

Note that you may receive an error about running scripts being disabled when activating within PowerShell. If you get this error then execute the following command:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```
:::

Once you've activated the environment, you need to ensure that you have the packages required to render your documents. This will typically encompass `jupyter` / `jupyterlab` plus whatever other packages are used in your Python code. Use `pip` to install packages into your environment. For example:

+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Platform     | Command                                              |
+==============+======================================================+
| Mac/Linux    | ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}                       |
|              | python3 -m pip install jupyter matplotlib pandas     |
|              | ```                                                  |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Windows      | ```{.powershell filename="Terminal"}                 |
|              | py -m pip install jupyter matplotlib pandas          |
|              | ```                                                  |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+

Assuming you installed all of the required packages (likely more than just `pandas` and `matplotlib`) you should now be able to `quarto render` documents within the directory.

To deactivate an environment use the `deactivate` command:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
deactivate
```

### Saving Environments {.platform-table}

To make your environment reproducible, you need to create a `requirements.txt` file that enumerates all of the packages in use. To do this use the `pip freeze` command:

+--------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Platform     | Command                                      |
+==============+==============================================+
| Mac/Linux    | ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}               |
|              | python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt     |
|              | ```                                          |
+--------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Windows      | ```{.powershell filename="Terminal"}         |
|              | py -m pip freeze > requirements.txt          |
|              | ```                                          |
+--------------+----------------------------------------------+

You should generally check the `requirements.txt` file into version control.

### Restoring Environments {.platform-table}

To reproduce the environment on another machine you create an empty environment, activate it, and then `pip install` using `requirements.txt`:

First, follow the [instructions above](#using-venv) for creating and activating a virtual environment for your platform/shell.

Then, install packages from `requirements.txt`:

+--------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Platform     | Command                                        |
+==============+================================================+
| Mac/Linux    | ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}                 |
|              | python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt     |
|              | ```                                            |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Windows      | ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}                 |
|              | py -m pip install -r requirements.txt          |
|              | ```                                            |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------+

## Using conda {.platform-table}

This section will cover the basics of creating and using conda environments with Quarto projects. See this article on [managing project specific environments](https://towardsdatascience.com/managing-project-specific-environments-with-conda-406365a539ab) with Conda for additional details.

To create a new environment in the directory `env`:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
conda create --prefix env python
```

If this is the first time you've used conda in your shell, you may need to execute one of the following commands before using other conda tools:

+--------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Shell              | Command                               |
+====================+=======================================+
| Newer Mac\         | ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}        |
| (Zsh)              | conda init zsh                        |
|                    | ```                                   |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Linux / Older Mac\ | ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}        |
| (Bash)             | conda init bash                       |
|                    | ```                                   |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Windows\           | ```{.powershell filename="Terminal"}  |
| (Command)          | conda init cmd.exe                    |
|                    | ```                                   |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Windows\           | ```{.powershell filename="Terminal"}  |
| (PowerShell)       | conda init powershell                 |
|                    | ```                                   |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------+

You will likely need to exit and restart your terminal for `conda init` to be reflected in your session.

To use the environment you need to activate it, which you do as follows:

+--------------+--------------------------------------+
| Platform     | Command                              |
+==============+======================================+
| Mac/Linux    | ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}       |
|              | conda activate ./env                 |
|              | ```                                  |
+--------------+--------------------------------------+
| Windows      | ```{.powershell filename="Terminal"} |
|              | conda activate .\env                 |
|              | ```                                  |
+--------------+--------------------------------------+

Once you've activated the environment, you need to ensure that you have the packages required to render your documents. This will typically encompass `jupyter` / `jupyterlab` plus whatever other packages are used in your Python code. Use `conda install` to install packages into your environment. For example:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
conda install jupyter
conda install pandas matplotlib 
```

Assuming you installed all of the required packages (likely more than just `pandas` and `matplotlib`) you should now be able to `quarto render` documents within the directory.

Use `conda deactivate` to exit an activated environment:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
conda deactivate
```

### Saving Environments

To make your environment reproducible, you need to create a `environment.yml` file that enumerates all of the packages in use. Do this using the `conda env export` command:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
conda env export > environment.yml
```

You should generally check the `environment.yml` file into version control.

### Restoring Environments

To reproduce the environment on another machine you just pass the `environment.yml` file as an argument to `conda env create`:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
conda env create --prefix env -f environment.yml
```

### More information

For more on conda's `environment.yml`, see Conda's [Managing Environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) documentation.

## Using renv

The [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) package provides functionality similar to the venv and conda, but for R packages. To create a new renv environment, install the **renv** package from CRAN then call the `renv::init()` function:

``` r
install.packages("renv")
renv::init()
```

As part of initialization, your `.Rprofile` file is modified to ensure that the renv is activated automatically at the start of each R session.

If you plan on using **both** R and Python in your project, you can have renv automatically create and manage a Python virtual environment as follows:

``` r
renv::use_python()
```

To install R packages use the standard R `install.packages` function. You can also install GitHub packages using the `renv::install` function. For example:

``` r
install.packages("ggplot2")      # install from CRAN
renv::install("tidyverse/dplyr") # install from GitHub
```

To install Python packages just use `pip` as described above from the built-in RStudio terminal.

### Saving Environments

To record the current versions of all R (and optionally Python) packages, use the `renv::snapshot()` function:

``` r
renv::snapshot()
```

This will record an `renv.lock` file for R packages and a `requirements.txt` file for Python packages). These files should be checked into version control.

### Restoring Environments

To reproduce the environment on another machine use the `renv::restore()` function:

``` r
renv::restore()
```

## JupyterLab {#jupyterlab .platform-table}

To use Jupyter or JupyterLab within a Python virtual environment you just need to activate the environment and then launch the Jupyter front end. For example:

+----------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Shell                | Command                              |
+======================+======================================+
|                      | ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}       |
| Mac/Linux            | source env/bin/activate              |
|                      | python3 -m jupyter lab               |
|                      | ```                                  |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------+
|                      | ```{.powershell filename="Terminal"} |
| Windows\             | env\Scripts\activate.bat             |
| (Command)            | py -m jupyter lab                    |
|                      | ```                                  |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------+
|                      | ```{.powershell filename="Terminal"} |
| Windows\             | env\Scripts\Activate.ps1             |
| (PowerShell)         | py -m jupyter lab                    |
|                      | ```                                  |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------+

All of the Python packages installed within the `env` will be available in your Jupyter notebook session. The workflow is similar if you are using conda environments.

## RStudio {#rstudio}

If you are using Quarto within RStudio it is strongly recommended that you use the [current release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) of RStudio from <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> (the documentation below assumes you are using this build).

### renv

If you are using **renv**, RStudio will automatically do the right thing in terms of binding Quarto to the R and/or Python packages in your project-local environments.

If you need to install R packages, use `install.packages`; if you need to install Python packages, simply use `pip` or `conda` within the terminal as described above.

### venv / condaenv

RStudio will automatically activate any venv or condaenv that it finds within a project directory. Just be sure to create an RStudio project within the same directory where you created your `env` and things will work as expected with no additional configuration.

If you need to install Python packages, simply use `pip` or `conda` within the terminal as described above.

## VS Code {#vs-code}

If you create a virtual environment in the `env/` directory as described above, Visual Studio Code should automatically discover that environment when you load a workspace from the environment's parent directory.

Note that this applies only to `venv` not Conda environments (which have a separate mechanism for binding to the current VS Code session).

You can read more about VS Code support for virtual environments here: <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments>.
