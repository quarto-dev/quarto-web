## Overview

Project profiles enable you to adapt the options, environment, and content of your projects for different scenarios. For example:

-   You may want to have distinct execution behavior when running on a production server. For example, you may want to use `freeze` or `cache` when rendering locally but always execute all of the code when running on a CI server.
-   You may want to provide distinct access credentials for databases or web services depending on the profile.
-   You may want to create different versions of a book from the same source code (e.g. a basic and advanced version).

When a project profile is activated a number of things occur:

1)  Profile specific `config` is merged with the top-level `_quarto.yml`.
2)  Profile specific [environment variables](environment.qmd#profile-environments) are applied.
3)  Divs can use the `when-profile` attribute to target content specifically for that project.
4)  The `QUARTO_PROFILE` environment variable includes the profile name so that other code (e.g. Python or R code) can condition its behavior on the active profile.

### Examples

Here's an example of a `_quarto.yml` file that is extended by a `production` configuration defined in `_quarto-production.yml`. When activated, the `production` profile overrides the default rendering execution behavior (disabling the use of `freeze`):

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website
  
execute: 
  freeze: true
```

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto-production.yml"}
execute:
  freeze: false
```

When the `production` profile is active, its configuration will be [merged](quarto-projects.qmd#metadata-merging) over the default project config (in this case resulting in the use of the frozen computational results being disabled).

Here's an example of using the `when-profile` attribute to include content only when the `advanced` profile is active:

``` markdown
::: {.content-visible when-profile="advanced"}
This content will only appear in the advanced version.
:::
```

The next section covers how to activate profiles, then subsequent sections go into more depth on the various capabilities of profiles.

## Activating Profiles

One or more named profiles can be activated by using either the `QUARTO_PROFILE` environment variable or the `--profile` command line argument.

Here we activate a profile using the `QUARTO_PROFILE` environment variable:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
export QUARTO_PROFILE=production
quarto render
```

Here we activate a profile by passing the `--profile` argument on the Quarto command line:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render --profile production
```

The use of the `--profile` command line argument entirely replaces any defined `QUARTO_PROFILE` within the environment.

Note that more than one profile can be activated at once. For example, here we activate both the `production` and `advanced` profiles:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render --profile production,advanced
```

## Profile Configuration

Define profile-specific configuration by adding an additional project file that includes the name of the profile (for example, `_quarto-advanced.yml` for the `advanced` profile). For example, here we customize the `title` and `output-dir` based on the currently active profile:

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  title: "My Website"
  type: website
```

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto-advanced.yml"}
project:
  title: "My Website (Advanced)"
  output-dir: _site-advanced
```

It's important to note that multiple profiles can be active. So the following enables you to vary configuration based on both `advanced` and `production` profiles:

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  title: "My Website"
  type: website
  
execute:
  freeze: true
```

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto-advanced.yml"}
project:
  title: "My Website (Advanced)"
  output-dir: _site-advanced
```

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto-production.yml"}
execute:
  freeze: false
```

The `advanced` and `production` profiles would each be applied if you specify them both:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
# multiple profiles in environment
export QUARTO_PROFILE=advanced,production
quarto render

# multiple profiles on command line
quarto render --profile advanced,production
```

## Profile Content

You can also specify that content within your project only be included when a certain profile is active. You do this using the `.content-visible` class along with the `when-profile` attribute to a div or span. For example, here we defined a div that is included only for the `advanced` profile:

``` markdown
::: {.content-visible when-profile="advanced"}
This content will only appear in the advanced version.
:::
```

You can also exclude content from a given profile using the `unless-profile` attribute. Here we include content only when the profile is not `advanced`:

``` markdown
::: {.content-visible unless-profile="advanced"}
This content will appear in all versions save for advanced.
:::
```

It might be more clear to re-write the above using `.content-hidden`:

``` markdown
::: {.content-hidden when-profile="advanced"}
This content will be hidden in the advanced profile
:::
```

## Profile Groups

Often times a set of profile names form a mutually exclusive group, and you want to make sure that at least one of the profiles is always active. For example, here we define distinct chapter lists for `basic` and `advanced` profiles, along with a profile `group` entry indicating that they form a group:

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: book
  
book:
  title: "My Book"
  author: "Norah Jones"

profile:
  group: 
    - [basic, advanced]
```

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto-basic.yml"}
book:
  chapters:
    - intro.qmd
    - using.qmd
    - summary.qmd
```

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto-advanced.yml"}
book:
  chapters:
    - intro.qmd
    - using.qmd
    - advanced.qmd
    - summary.qmd
```

You'll note that the base options for `book` do not include a chapter list (as we rely on the profiles for distinct lists). This means that to successfully render the project, you always need to have a profile defined---this might be inconvenient especially for local authoring and preview.

By specifying a `group` we indicate that one of the profiles must be defined, and that the first one listed should be used as the default when no others are present.

## Default Profile

When authoring a Quarto project that uses profiles you might want to change which profile(s) are rendered by default to try out different variations of the project.

While you could certainly do this by defining environment variables in your shell, this isn't particularly convenient when using the integrated render and preview functionality in VS Code and RStudio.

To define a default profile that is used when an explicit `QUARTO_PROFILE` or `--profile` CLI argument is not present, add a `default` option to the `profile` key. For example, here we indicate that `development` should be the active profile is not otherwise specified:

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
profile:
  default: development
```
