## Overview

Quarto makes it easy to create a simple about page for an individual or organization. When the `about` option is provided for a document, a special template will be used to layout the content of the current page with a custom layout designed to present a person or organization.

For example:

``` markdown
---
title: "Finley Malloc"
about:
  template: jolla
  image: profile.jpg
  links:
    - icon: twitter
      text: twitter
      href: https://twitter.com
    - icon: github
      text: Github
      href: https://github.com
---

The contents of this page will be laid out using the `jolla` template with the `profile.jpg` image, and generate a set of links for the items specified in `links`.

You can write and format the content of the page however you'd like - when the page is rendered, Quarto will use the content and options provided in the `about` option to create the about page, arranging the content of the `about` option with the content in the page itself.

## Templates

Quarto includes 5 built in templates, drawing inspiration from the [Postcards R Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/postcards/readme/README.html). Built-in templates include:

-   `jolla`
-   `trestles`
-   `solana`
-   `marquee`
-   `broadside`

Each template will position the about elements with the content in a different layout. Select the template using the `template` option:

``` yaml
about:
  template: trestles
```

Here is a preview of each of the templates:

### Image

The image for the about page will be read from the document-level `image` option:

``` yaml
title: Finley Malloc
image: profile.jpg
about:
  template: jolla
```

In addition, you can customize how the image is displayed in the page to better meet your needs by setting the following options.

| option        | description                                                                           | templates                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| `image-width` | A valid CSS width for your image.                                                     | all                           |
| `image-shape` | The shape of the image on the about page. Choose from:`rectangle`, `round`, `rounded` | `jolla`, `solana`, `trestles` |
| `image-alt`   | Alternative text for image                                                            | all                           |
| `image-title` | Title for image                                                                       | all                           |

For example:

``` yaml
title: Finley Malloc
image: profile.png
about:
  template: trestles
  image-width: 10em
  image-shape: round
```

### Links

Your about page also may contain a set of links to other resources about you or your organization. Each template will render these links in a slightly different way. Here are the options that you can specify for each link:

| Option       | Description                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `href`       | Link to file contained with the project or an external URL.                                                                        |
| `text`       | Text to display for navigation item (defaults to the document `title` if not provided).                                            |
| `icon`       | Name of one of the standard [Bootstrap 5 icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) (e.g. "github", "twitter", "share", etc.).        |
| `aria-label` | [Accessible label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) for the navigation item. |

## Partial Page Content

By default, the about page will be generated using the entire contents of the page. If you'd like, however, you may also choose to use only a portion of the page's content to populate the about template. In this case, you can specify an `id` for the about page in the document front matter. When rendering the page, Quarto will find any `div` with that `id` and use the contents of that `div` to populate the about template. The `div` that provided the contents will be replaced with the formatted 'about' content. For example, you could write:

``` markdown
---
title: "Finley Malloc"
about:
  id: hero-heading
  template: jolla
  image: profile.jpg
  links:
    - icon: twitter
      text: twitter
      href: https://twitter.com
    - icon: github
      text: Github
      href: https://github.com
---
