## Overview

There are a variety of options available for providing website navigation, including:

-   Using top navigation (a navbar) with optional sub-menus.

-   Using side navigation with a hierarchy of pages.

-   Combining top and side navigation (where top navigation links to different sections of the site with their own side navigation).

In addition, you can add full text search to either the top or side navigation interface.

## Top Navigation

To add top-navigation to a website, add a `navbar` entry to the `website` config in `_quarto.yml`. For example, the following YAML:

``` yaml
website:
  navbar:
    background: primary
    search: true
    left:
      - text: "Home"
        file: index.qmd
      - talks.qmd
      - about.qmd 
```

Results in a navigation bar that looks something like this:

![](images/nav-bar.png){fig-alt="A navigation bar. The title 'My Site' is on the left. To the right of the title are the words 'Home', 'Talks', and 'About'. 'Home' is slightly lighter than the other two words. On the far right side of the navigation bar is a search box."}

Above we use the `left` option to specify items for the left side of the navigation bar. You can also use the `right` option to specify items for the right side.

The text for navigation bar items will be taken from the underlying target document's title. Note that in the above example we provide a custom `text: "Home"` value for `index.qmd`.

You can also create a navigation bar menu by including a `menu` (which is a list of items much like `left` and `right)`. For example:

``` yaml
left:
  - text: "More"
    menu:
      - talks.qmd
      - about.qmd 
```

Here are all of the options available for top navigation:

| `pinned`         | Always show the navbar (true or false). Defaults to false, and uses [headroom.js](https://wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js/) to automatically show the navbar when the user scrolls up on the page.                         |
| `collapse`       | Collapse the navbar items into a hamburger menu when the display gets narrow (defaults to true).                                                                                                                            |

### Navbar Tools {#navbar-tools}

{{< include ../_require-1.3.qmd >}}

In addition to traditional navigation, the navbar can also display a set of tools (e.g. social actions, GitHub view or edit actions, etc.) A tool definition consists of an icon name and an href to follow when clicked. For icon, use the icon name of any of the 1,300+ Bootstrap Icons.

For example:

::: {layout="[60,40]"}
``` yaml
website:
  navbar:
    tools:
      - icon: twitter
        href: https://twitter.com
      - icon: github
        menu:
          - text: Source Code
            url:  https://code.com
          - text: Report a Bug
            url:  https://bugs.com
```

![](images/navbar-tools.png){.border alt="The right section of a Quarto navbar containing a Twitter and Github logo. The Github logo is selected and a menu is underneath it with two items: 'Source Code' and 'Report a Bug"}
:::

Tools specified for a navigation bar will appear on the right side of the Navbar. If you specify a dark theme or reader mode for your website, the controls for those options will appear with any specified tools.

When the navbar is collapsed into a menu on smaller screens, the tools will be placed at the bottom of the menu.

## Side Navigation {#side-navigation}

If your site consists of more than a handful of documents, you might prefer to use side navigation, which enables you to display an arbitrarily deep hierarchy of articles.

If you are reading this page on a desktop device then you will see the default side navigation display on the left (otherwise you'll see a title bar at the top which you can click or touch to reveal the navigation).

To add side navigation to a website, add a `sidebar` entry to the `website` section of `_quarto.yml`. For example:

``` yaml
website:
  sidebar:
    style: "docked"
    search: true
    contents:
      - section: "Basics"
        contents:
          - index.qmd
          - basics-knitr.qmd
          - basics-jupyter.qmd
      - section: "Layout"
        contents:
          - layout.qmd
          - layout-knitr.qmd
          - layout-jupyter.qmd
```

There are two styles of side navigation available: "docked" which shows the navigation in a sidebar with a distinct background color, and "floating" which places it closer to the main body text. Here's what the "docked" and "floating" styles look like (respectively):

::: column-screen-inset-shaded
|                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                         |
|:-------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|

:::

Here are all of the options available for side navigation:

| Option           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `title`          | Sidebar title (uses the project title if none is specified).                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `subtitle`       | Optional subtitle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `logo`           | Optional logo image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `search`         | Include a search box (true or false). Note that if there is already a search box on the top navigation bar it won't be displayed on the sidebar.                                                                                                                   |

| `items`          | List of navigation items to display (typically top level items will in turn have a list of sub-items).                                                                                                                                                             |
| `style`          | "docked" or "floating".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `collapse-level` | Whether to show sidebar navigation collapsed by default. The default is 2, which shows the top and next level fully expanded (but leaves the 3rd and subsequent levels collapsed).                                                                                 |
| `pinned`         | Always show a title bar that expands to show the sidebar at narrower screen widths (true or false). Defaults to false, and uses [headroom.js](https://wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js/) to automatically show the navigation bar when the user scrolls up on the page. |

For more information on controlling the appearance of the side navigation using HTML themes, see [HTML Themes - Navigation](/docs/output-formats/html-themes.qmd#navigation). If you need to control the width of the sidebar, see [Page Layout - Grid Customization](/docs/output-formats/page-layout.qmd#grid-customization).

### Auto Generation

Above we describe how to explicitly populate the `contents` of your sidebar with navigation items. You can also automatically generate sidebar navigation from the filesystem. The most straightforward way to do this is to specify the `contents` option as follows:

``` yaml
sidebar:
  contents: auto
```

Using `contents: auto` at the root level will result in all documents in your website being included within the navigation (save for the home page which can be navigated to via the title link). Navigation is constructed using the following rules:

1.  Navigation item titles will be read from the `title` field of documents.

2.  Sub-directories will create sections and will be automatically titled based on the directory name (including adding capitalization and substituting spaces for dashes and underscores). Use an `index.qmd` in the directory to provide an explicit `title` if you don't like the automatic one.

3.  Order is alphabetical (by filename) unless a numeric `order` field is provided in document metadata.

Automatic navigation automatically includes items in sub-directories. If you prefer not to do this, use an explicit `/*` to indicate only the documents in the root directory:

``` yaml
sidebar:
  contents: /*
```

Rather than specifying that all documents should be included, you can also specify a directory name or a glob pattern. For example, the following values for `contents` are all valid (note that the second form for `reports` is non-recursive):

``` yaml
sidebar:
  contents: reports
  
sidebar:
  contents: reports/*
  
sidebar:
  contents: "*.ipynb"
```

Note that in YAML we need to quote any strings that begin with `*` (as we do above for `*.ipynb`).

You can automatically build sidebar `contents` anywhere within a sidebar hierarchy. For example, here we add a section that is automatically generated from a directory:

``` yaml
sidebar:
  contents:
    - about.qmd
    - contributing.qmd
    - section: Reports
      contents: reports
```

You can also include automatically generated items in the middle of a list of normal items by including an item with an `auto` property. Here we add an `auto` entry in the middle of a list of items:

``` yaml
sidebar:
  contents:
    - about.qmd
    - contributing.qmd
    - auto: "*-report.qmd"
```

Note again that we quote the `auto` entry with a `*` in it so that it is correctly parsed.

### Sidebar Tools

In addition to traditional navigation, the sidebar can also display a set of tools (e.g. social actions, GitHub view or edit actions, etc.) A tool definition consists of an icon name and an href to follow when clicked. For `icon`, use the icon name of any of the 1,300+ [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com).

For example:

::: {layout="[60,40]"}
``` yaml
website:
  sidebar:
    tools:
      - icon: twitter
        href: https://twitter.com
      - icon: github
        menu:
          - text: Source Code
            url:  https://code.com
          - text: Report a Bug
            url:  https://bugs.com
```

![](images/tools.png){fit-alt="The top section of a Quarto sidebar containing a Twitter and Github logo. The Github logo is selected and a menu is underneath it with two items: 'Source Code' and 'Report a Bug'"}

## Hybrid Navigation

If you have a website with dozens or even hundreds of pages, you will likely want to use top and side navigation together, where the top navigation links to various sections, each with their own side navigation.

To do this, provide a group of `sidebar` entries and link each group of `sidebar` entries with a `navbar` entry by matching their `title`s and listing the page linked from the `navbar` as the first content in the `sidebar` group. For example, if you are using the [Diátaxis Framework](https://diataxis.fr/) for documentation, you might have separate sections for tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and reference documents, your page might look like the following.

![](images/nav-bar-hybrid.png){fig-alt="A navigation bar titled 'ProjectX' on the left. To the right of the title are the menu items 'Home', 'Tutorials', 'How-To', 'Fundamentals', and 'Reference'. There is a search bar on the far right side of the navigation bar."}

With hybrid navigation, if then you click on, say, Tutorials, you might land in a page like the following.

![](images/nav-bar-hybrid-sidebar.png){fig-alt="A navigation bar titled 'ProjectX' on the left. To the right of the title are the menu items 'Home', 'Tutorials', 'How-To', 'Fundamentals', and 'Reference'. There is a search bar on the far right side of the navigation bar. The contents of the 'Tutorials' page is shown, with the sidebar showing the items 'Tutorials', 'Tutorial 1', and 'Tutorial 2'."}

To achieve this layout, your site configuration needs to look something like this:

``` yaml
website:
  title: ProjectX
  navbar:
    background: primary
    search: true
    left:
      - text: "Home"
        file: index.qmd
      - text: "Tutorials"
        file: tutorials.qmd
      - text: "How-To"
        file: howto.qmd
      - text: "Fundamentals"
        file: fundamentals.qmd
      - text: "Reference"
        file: reference.qmd

  sidebar:
    - title: "Tutorials"
      style: "docked"
      background: light
      contents:
        - tutorials.qmd
        - tutorial-1.qmd
        - tutorial-2.qmd

    - title: "How-To"
      contents:
        - howto.qmd
        # navigation items

    - title: "Fundamentals"
      contents:
        - fundamentals.qmd
        # navigation items

    - title: "Reference"
      contents:
        - reference.qmd
        # navigation items
    
```

Note that the first sidebar definition contains a few options (e.g. `style` and `background`). These options are automatically inherited by the other sidebars.

An alternative approach is to make the `sidebar` entries available from a drop down menu from the `navbar` items they're grouped with. To do this, provide a list of `sidebar` entries and give them each an `id`, which you then use to reference them from the `navbar`.

::: callout-note
A page that doesn't appear in any sidebar will inherit and display the first sidebar- you can prevent the sidebar from showing on a page by setting `sidebar: false` in it's front matter.

![](images/nav-bar-hybrid-dropdown.png){fig-alt="A navigation bar titled 'ProjectX' on the left. To the right of the title are the menu items 'Home', 'Tutorials', 'How-To', 'Fundamentals', and 'Reference'. 'Home' is in a lighter color than the other menu options. The other menu options have a triangle pointing down next to each one, indicating the existence of a drop-down menu. There is a search bar on the far right side of the navigation bar."}

To achieve this, your site configuration needs to look something like this:

``` yaml
website:
  title: ProjectX
  navbar:
    background: primary
    search: true
    left:
      - text: "Home"
        file: index.qmd
      - sidebar:tutorials
      - sidebar:howto
      - sidebar:fundamentals
      - sidebar:reference

  sidebar:
    - id: tutorials
      title: "Tutorials"
      style: "docked"
      background: light
      collapse-level: 2
      contents: 
        # navigation items
        
    - id: howto
      title: "How-To"
      contents:
        # navigation items
        
    - id: fundamentals
      title: "Fundamentals"
      contents: :
        # navigation items
        
    - id: reference
      title: "Reference"
      contents: 
        # navigation items
    
```

{{< include _page-navigation.md >}}

### Separators

If you include a page separator in the sidebar (either between sections or items), page navigation controls will not appear to continue pagination across the separator. For example, in the following sidebar:

``` yaml
{{< meta project-type >}}:
  sidebar:
    contents:
      - section: "First Section"
        contents:
          - href: document1.qmd
          - href: document2.qmd
          - href: document3.qmd
      - text: "---"
      - section: "Second Section"
        contents:
          - href: document4.qmd
          - href: document5.qmd
          - href: document6.qmd
```

When the user reaches the bottom of document3.qmd, they will see previous navigation to go back to document2.qmd, but they will not see next navigation to continue onto document 4. This behavior is useful when you have sections of contents that don't naturally flow together in sequential order. Use the separator to denote this in the sidebar with a horizontal line and to break up pagination.

## Back to Top

You can include a "Back to top" link at the bottom of documents in a website using the `back-to-top-navigation` option. For example:

``` yaml
{{< meta project-type >}}:
  back-to-top-navigation: true
```

Note that you can disable back to top navigation on a page by page basis by specifying `back-to-top-navigation: false`.

{{< include _footer.md >}}

## Hiding Navigation

For some pages (especially those with a completely custom layout) you can hide navigation altogether (`navbar`, `sidebar`, or both). In these case, add the following to the page front matter:

``` yaml
# Hides the sidebar on this page
sidebar: false

# Hides the navbar on this page
navbar: false
```

## Reader Mode

If you'd like users to be able to hide the side navigation and table of contents and have a more focused reading experience, you can enabled `reader-mode`. When enabled, a `reader-mode` toggle will appear on the navbar, if present, or on the sidebar. When pressed, the toggle will 'roll up' the sidebar and table of contents.

![](images/reader-mode.png){fig-alt="Reader mode toggle appearing the top navigation."}

To enable `reader-mode`, use the following in your project:

``` yaml
website:
  reader-mode: true
```

## Site Search

You can add site search by including `search: true` in either your `site-navbar` or `site-sidebar` configuration. For example:

``` yaml
website:
  sidebar:
    style: "docked"
    search: true
    items:
      - text: "Basics"
        contents:
          - index.qmd
          - basics-jupyter.md
        # etc
```

## GitHub Links

You can add various links (e.g. to edit pages, report issues, etc.) to the GitHub repository where your site source code is hosted. To do this, add a `repo-url` along with one or more actions in `repo-actions`. For example:

``` yaml
website:
  repo-url: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-demo
  repo-actions: [edit, issue]
```

The links will be displayed immediately below the page's table of contents:

![](images/repo-actions.png){.border fig-alt="A screen shot of a Quarto document. Underneath the page table of contents on the right side are two options: 'Edit this page' and 'Report an issue'. There is a Github icon to the left of 'Edit this Page.'"}

There are a couple of additional options that enable you to customize the behavior of repository links:

| Option        | Description                                                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `repo-subdir` | Subdirectory of repository containing source files (defaults to root directory). |
| `repo-branch` | Repository branch containing the source files (defaults to `main`)               |
| `issue-url`   | Provide an explicit URL for the 'Report an Issue' action.                        |

: {tbl-colwidths="\[40,60\]"}

## Redirects

If you rename or move a page on your site, you may want to create redirects from the old URLs so that existing links don't break. You can do this by adding `aliases` from old pages to renamed pages.

For example, let's say you renamed `page.qmd` to `renamed-page.qmd`. You would add the following `aliases` entry to `renamed-page.qmd` to create the redirect:

``` yaml
---
title: "Renamed Page"
aliases:
  - page.html
---
```

This can also be useful for situations where you re-organize content on your site into a different directory hierarchy or break one large article into smaller ones. For this case, you may want to add the URL hash of the section that you have broken into a new page. For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "Learning More"
aliases:
  - overview.html#learning-more
---
```

::: callout-tip
Depending on where you are deploying your site there may be more powerful tools available for defining redirects based on patterns. For example, Netlify [`_redirects`](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/) files or [`.htaccess`](https://www.danielmorell.com/guides/htaccess-seo/redirects/introduction-to-redirects) files. Search your web host's documentation for "redirects" to see if any of these tools are available.

## 404 Pages {#pages-404}

When a browser can't find a requested web page, it displays a [404 error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) indicating that the file can't be found. Browser default 404 pages can be pretty stark, so you may want to create a custom page with a more friendly message and perhaps pointers on how users might find what they are looking for.

Most web serving platforms (e.g. Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.) will use a file named `404.html` in the root of your website as a custom error page if you provide it. You can include a custom 404 page in a Quarto website by creating a markdown file named `404.qmd` in the root of your project. For example:

``` markdown
---
title: Page Not Found
---

The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).

You may want to try searching to find the page's new location.
```

Note that you can use HTML alongside markdown within your `404.qmd` file in order to get exactly the appearance and layout you want.

Your 404 page will appear within the chrome of your site (e.g. fonts, css, layout, navigation, etc.). This is so that users don't feel that they've irrecoverably "left" your site when they get a 404 error. If you don't want this behavior, then provide a `404.html` rather than `404.qmd`.

Here are some examples of how various popular websites handle custom 404 pages: <https://blog.fluidui.com/top-404-error-page-examples/>.

#### Non-Root Site Paths

If your website is served from the root of a domain (e.g. <https://example.com/>) then simply providing a `404.qmd` file as described above is all that's required to create a custom 404 page.

However, if your website is **not** served from the root of a domain then you need to provide one additional bit of configuration to make sure that resources (e.g. your site's CSS) are resolved correctly within 404 pages.

For example, if your site is served from <https://example.com/mysite/> then you'd add the following to your project `website` configuration within `_quarto.yml`:

``` yaml
website:
  title: "My Site"
  site-path: "/mysite/"
```

Note that if you are already providing a `site-url` (which is required for generation of sitemaps and [social metadata](website-tools.qmd#social-metadata) preview images) then it's enough to simply include the path within the `site-url`:

``` yaml
website:
  title: "My Site"
  site-url: "https://example.com/mysite/"
```
