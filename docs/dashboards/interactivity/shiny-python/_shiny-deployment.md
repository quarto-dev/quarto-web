Shiny interactive documents are normal Shiny applications that are created using `quarto render`. In fact, you don't need Quarto at all to serve interactive documents, rather, you can just `shiny run` the application generated by `quarto render`:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render example.qmd
shiny run app.py
```

Your deployed application will consist of both the HTML document and `app.py` script generated by `quarto render`:

``` bash
example.html
example_files/
app.py
```

See the following documentation for information on deploying Shiny applications in various environments:

You can also deploy interactive Shiny documents in a serverless configuration (where Python runs in the browser via [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/)). The [Retirement Simulation](https://github.com/wch/retirement-simulation-dashboard) is an example that demonstrates this workflow.
