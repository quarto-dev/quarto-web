## Overview

Quarto Dashboards make it easy to create interactive dashboards using Python, R, Julia, and Observable:

-   Publish a group of related data visualizations as a dashboard. Dashboards can be deployed as static web pages (no special server required). 

-   Support for a wide variety of components including [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), [Leaflet](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Jupyter Widgets](/docs/interactive/widgets/jupyter.qmd), [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/); static graphics (Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2, etc.); tabular data; value boxes; and text annotations.

-   Flexible and easy to specify row and column-based [Layouts](layouts.qmd). Components are intelligently re-sized to fill the browser and adapted for display on mobile devices.

-   Author using any notebook editor ([JupyterLab](/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.qmd), etc.) or in plain text markdown with any text editor ([VS Code](/docs/tools/vscode.qmd), [RStudio](/docs/tools/rstudio.qmd), [Neovim](/docs/tools/neovim.qmd), etc.)

-   Optionally integrate dashboards with a backend [Shiny Server](/docs/dashboards/interactivity/shiny-python.qmd) for interactivity.

Below we'll walk through a simple example to illustrate the basics. Then, we'll provide detailed instructions on how to get started with building your own dashboards.

## Walkthrough

This very simple single-page dashboard uses interactive Plotly visualizations to explore various development indicators in the [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/) dataset. The dashboard includes two rows, the second of which includes two columns:

Dashboards consist of several components:

1)  **Navigation Bar** --- Icon, title, and author along with links to sub-pages (if more than one page is defined).

2)  **Pages, Rows, Columns, and Tabsets** --- Pages, rows and columns are defined using markdown headings (with optional attributes to control height, width, etc.). Tabsets can be used to further divide content within a row or column.

3)  **Cards and Sidebars** --- Cards are containers for data, visualizations, and free from content. The content of cards typically maps to *cells* in your notebook or source document. Sidebars are used to present inputs within interactive dashboards.

Dashboards can be created either using Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) or using plain text markdown (`.qmd`). Here is the code for the notebook version of the above example:

Here is the plain text `.qmd` version of the dashboard (click on the numbers on the far right for additional explanation of syntax and mechanics):

```` python
--- 
title: "Development Indicators by Continent" # <1>
author: "Gapminder Analytics Group" # <1>
format: dashboard # <1>

```{{python}}
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.gapminder()
```

## Row {height=60%} # <2>

```{{python}}  # <3>
#| title: GDP and Life Expectancy 
px.scatter(  
  df, x="gdpPercap", y="lifeExp", 
  animation_frame="year", animation_group="country", 
  size="pop", color="continent", hover_name="country",
  facet_col="continent", log_x=True, size_max=45, 
  range_x=[100,100000], range_y=[25,90] 
)  
``` # <3>

## Row {height=40%}

```{{python}} # <4>
#| title: Population
px.area(
  df, x="year", y="pop", 
  color="continent", line_group="country"
)
```

```{{python}}
#| title: Life Expectancy
px.line(
  df, x="year", y="lifeExp", 
  color="continent", line_group="country"
)
``` # <4>
````

1.  The document options define the `title` and `author` for the navigation bar as well as specifying the use of the `dashboard` format.
2.  Rows and columns are defined using headers. In this example we define two rows and specify their relative sizes using the `height` option.
3.  Computational cells become cards that live within rows or columns. Cards can have an optional title (which here we specify using the `title` option).
4.  The second row includes two computational cells, which are automatically spit into two side by side cards.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Quarto Pre-Release

Dashboards are a feature in the upcoming 1.4 release of Quarto and are still under active development. Before you get started, make sure you install the **latest pre-release** version of Quarto.
