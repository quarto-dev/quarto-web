  "description": "## Confluence Publishing\n\n- Add support for publishing both documents and projects to Atlassian Confluence spaces and as children to Confluence pages.\n\n## Jupyter Notebooks\n\n- Add support for embedding cell outputs in quarto documents using `{{< embed >}}`. You can address cells by Id, Tag, or label, such as `{{< embed mynotebook.ipynb#fig-output >}}` which would embed the output of a cell with the label `fig-output`). You can also provide a list of ids like `{{< embed mynotebook.ipynb#fig-output,tbl-out >}}`.\n- Only attempt to postprocess `text/plain` output if it's nonempty ([#3896](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3896)).\n- Fix output of bokeh plots so the right number of cells is generated ([#2107](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2107)).\n- Fix output of code cells that contain triple backticks (or more) ([#3179](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3179)).\n- Don't install SIGCHLD signal handler since it interferes with IJulia in Julia 1.8.4 and greater ([#2539](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2539)).\n- Resolve full path to QUARTO_PYTHON binary\n\n## Code Annotation\n\n- Add support for annotation of code cells (executable or non-executable).

For more information, see [https://www.quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html](https://www.quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html).\n- Fix wrapping of long `code` entries inside table cells ([#3221](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3221))\n- Fix author display to use the `url` for an author even when there is no affiliation.\n- Add support for linking to other formats, when more than one format is produced. Alternate formats will appear with the TOC. Control using `format-links`.\n- Add support for linking to source notebooks that provide embedded content. Control using `notebook-links`\n- Improve callout wrapping behavior for long strings with no word breaks.\n- Add overflow to tables generated from SQL code cells ([#3497](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3497)).\n- Fix support for parquet files in OJS code cells ([#3630](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3630)).\n- Forward bootstrap table classes from caption to table element ([#4036](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4036)).\n- Render code listings with names and captions correctly ([#2195](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2195)).\n- Fix issue with interactivity of elements in mobile size dispay when `toc-left` is being used. ([#4244](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4244)).\n- Allow control of the 'cite as' appendix in HTML documents using `appendix-cite-as` (pass `false`, `display`, or `bibtex`). ([#2625](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2625))\n- Properly anchor custom appendix sections ([#3112](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3112)).\n- Don't display custom appendix sections in the TOC ([#3113](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3113)).\n\n## Article Layout\n\n- Improve positioning of margin content defined within tabsets.

Starting in in Quarto 1.3, all Quarto features will be enabled for the `latexmk` engine and `latexmk` will be used to run the PDF generation loop.\n- Fix author processing in default PDFs for complex author names (#3483)\n- Remove excessive vertical space between theorem type blocks ([#3776](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3776)).\n- Fix temporary `.tex` filenames in the presence of multiple variants ([#3762](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3762)).\n  - Note that this fix changes the filenames used for PDF files with variants.
