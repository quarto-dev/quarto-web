  "description": "## Changes\n\n## Jupyter Notebooks\n\n- Add support for embedding cell outputs in quarto documents using `{{< embed >}}`. You can address cells by Id, Tag, or label, such as `{{< embed mynotebook.ipynb#fig-output >}}` which would embed the output of a cell with the label `fig-output`). You can also provide a list of ids like `{{< embed mynotebook.ipynb#fig-output,tbl-out >}}`.\n\n## Code Annotation\n\n- Add support for annotation of code cells (executable or non-executable). You can read more about code annotation at [https://www.quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html](https://www.quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html).\n\n## HTML Format\n\n- Improved handling of margin references that appear within a callout. ([#3003](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3003))\n- Add support for customizing the baseline widths of grid columns using yaml or scss. For more information, see [https://www.quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html](https://www.quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html).\n- Fix wrapping of long `code` entries inside table cells ([#3221](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3221))\n- Fix author display to use the `url` for an author even when there is no affiliation.\n- Add support for linking to other formats, when more than one format is produced. Alternate formats will appear with the TOC. Control using `format-links`.\n- Add support for linking to source notebooks that provide embedded content. Control using `notebook-links`\n- Improve callout wrapping behavior for long strings with no word breaks.\n- Add overflow to tables generated from SQL code cells ([#3497](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3497)).\n\n## Article Layout\n\n- Improve positioning of margin content defined within tabsets. (#3280)\n\n## Revealjs Format\n\n- reduce font size of `df-print: paged` tables ([#3380](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3380))\n\n## Dates\n\n- Properly fall back to language only locale when a supported language-region locale isn't available. (#3059)\n\n## PDF Format\n\n- Fix wrong page number in the TOC for appendices ([#3164](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3164)) (Thank you, @iusgit!)\n- Add support for automatically converting SVG images to PDF ([#2575](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2575))\n- Previously, if the `pdf-engine` was set to `latexmk`, we would bypass many features of Quarto and use Pandoc to produce the PDF output. Starting in in Quarto 1.3, all Quarto features will be enabled for the `latexmk` engine and `latexmk` will be used to run the PDF generation loop.\n- Fix author processing in default PDFs for complex author names (#3483)\n\n## Beamer Format\n\n- Document `theme` format metadata option ([#3377](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3377))\n\n## Mermaid diagrams\n\n- Upgrade to mermaid 9.2.2\n- Add support for theming mermaid diagrams in Javascript formats ([#2165](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2165)). See the [prerelease documentation notes](https://quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html) for details.\n- Allow `%%| label` mermaid cell option that control the `id` of the resulting SVG, to facilitate CSS overrides.\n- Use `htmlLabels: false` in mermaid flowcharts.\n- Remove support for tooltips, which appear to not be working in mermaid 9.2.2.\n- Add support for `fig-align` in mermaid diagrams in HTML format ([#3294](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3294))\n\n## Dates\n\n- Properly fall back to language only locale when a supported language-region locale isn't available. ([#3059](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3059))\n\n## About Pages\n\n- Add support for `image-alt` which provides alternate text for the about page image. ([#3010](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3010))\n\n## Article Layout\n\n- Improve the performance of extremely large documents with margin elements by improving the efficiency of positioning the elements.\n\n## Listings\n\n- Listings now support `template-params`, which will be passed to custom EJS templates in a variable called `templateParams` when a listing is rendered.\n- Custom listing objects now resolve `path: ` fields into the metadata that would be generated by standard listings, giving custom listing access to computed metadata like `reading-time`, etc.\n- Improve support for `date-modified` in listings\n- Improve support for `yml` based listings by supporting usage of title and description from `yml`.\n- Allow listings in project to point directly to non-input files (such as `yml` files) to use for contents.\n\n## Websites\n\n- Fix issue assigning specific sidebar to a specific page using `sidebar:` (#3389)\n- Change behavior of `publish gh-pages` to always render into a clean directory.\n  Previous behavior was to add to existing contents of `gh-pages` branch. ([#3199](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3199), @ijlyttle)\n\n## Books\n\n- Remove chapter number of HTML head title when `number-sections` is `false` (#3304).\n\n## Preview\n\n- Correct redirect for VS Code Server (#3352) (Thank you, @benz0li!)\n\n## LUA\n\n- `quarto.version()` now returns `Version` object that simplifies comparison (thank you @tarleb)\n\n## HTML Output\n\n- HTML output will not decorate links within source code (for example, from `code-link: true`) with external icons. (#3755)\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n- Work around pandoc strict checking of `number-offset` type. ([#3126](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3126))\n- Warn instead of crash on bad URI ([#3220](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3220))\n- ensure `video` shortcode works with `embed-resources` and `self-contained` ([#3310](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3310))\n- Add optional `rel` attribute to navigation links ([#3212](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3212))\n- Use the right port when CRI is initialized multiple times ([#3066](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3066))\n- Allow custom themes for giscus ([#3105](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3105))\n- Add new `kbd` shortcode, to describe keyboard keys ([#3384](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3384)). See the [pre-release documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html) for details.\n- Replace default style for date picker component in OJS ([#2863](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2863)).\n- `quarto check` now supports `quarto check versions` for checking binary dependency versions in the case of custom binaries ([#3602](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3602)).\n- the API for shortcode handlers in lua now accepts a fourth parameter `raw_args` which hold the unparsed arguments in a table ([#3833](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3833)).\n- remove scaffolding div from conditional content in final output ([#3847](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3847)).\n\n## Pandoc filter changes\n\n- Quarto 1.3 introduces the notion of Custom AST nodes to Pandoc filters. If you use Lua filters for processing callouts, tabsets, or conditional blocks, consult the [pre-release documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html) for how to change your filters to support the new syntax.\n"
