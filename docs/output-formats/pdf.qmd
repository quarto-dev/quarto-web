## Overview

Quarto supports two paths to PDF output:

-   `typst` --- [Typst](#typst) (bundled with Quarto)

-   `pdf` --- [LaTeX](#latex) via TeX (e.g., TinyTeX, TeX Live)

Both produce high-quality documents but differ in setup, speed, and customization.

## Typst

Use `format: typst` for the fastest path to PDF. Typst is bundled with Quarto—no additional installation required. It offers fast compilation, simpler customization syntax, and a gentler learning curve.

Choose Typst if you're new to PDF generation, want quick results, or are working from Typst templates.

See [Typst Basics](typst.qmd) to get started.

## LaTeX

Use `format: pdf` to generate PDFs via LaTeX. This requires a TeX distribution (e.g., TinyTeX, TeX Live), but gives you access to the vast ecosystem of LaTeX packages and templates.

Choose LaTeX if you need specific LaTeX packages, are working with journal or publisher templates, or have existing LaTeX workflows.

See [LaTeX Basics](pdf-basics.qmd) to get started.
