Quarto includes integrated support for [`axe-core`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core), a broadly-supported, open source, industry standard tool for accessibility checks in HTML documents.

## Accessibility checks with `axe-core`

To enable the simplest form of accessibility checks in Quarto 1.8, add the `axe` YAML metadata configuration to HTML `format`s (`html`, `dashboard`, and `revealjs`):

``` yaml
format:
  html:
    axe: true
```

In this situation, if your webpage has accessibility violations that `axe-core` can catch, Quarto will produce console messages that are visible by opening your browser's development tools.

### Customization

Quarto supports two additional output formats for the accessibility checks, available through the `output` option.

-   `document`: embedded reports

    ``` yaml
    format:
      html:
        axe:
          output: document 
    ```

    With this option, Quarto will generate a visible report of `axe-core` violations on the webpage itself. This is useful for visual inspection of a page. Note that with this setting, Quarto will always produce a report.

    If you wish to use this feature, we recommend adding it to a "debug" [project profile](/docs/projects/profiles.qmd) to reduce the chance you will accidentally publish a website to production with these reports.

-   `json`: JSON-formatted console output

    ``` yaml
    format:
      html:
        axe:
          output: json
    ```

    This option is useful if you're comfortable with browser automation tools such as [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), since it produces output to the console in a format that can be easily consumed.

    Specifically, the JSON object produced is the result of running `axe-core`'s `run` method on the webpage. We defer to `axe-core`'s [documentation for full information on that object](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core).

-   `console`

    ``` yaml
    format:
      html:
        axe:
          output: console
    ```

    This option is equivalent to `axe: true`.

## Example: insufficient contrast

As a minimal example of how this works in Quarto, consider this simple document:

::: light-content

``` markdown
---
title: Testing Quarto's accessibility checker
format:
  html: 
    axe:
      output: document
---

This violates contrast rules: [insufficient contrast.]{style="color: #eee"}.
```

:::

::: dark-content

``` markdown
---
title: Testing Quarto's accessibility checker
format:
  html: 
    axe:
      output: document
---

This violates contrast rules: [insufficient contrast.]{style="color: #111"}.
```

::: 


This is the produced result visible on the page:

::: {.light-content}
![The rendered webpage with an accessibility violation warning](images/axe-violation.png)
:::

::: {.dark-content}
![The rendered webpage with an accessibility violation warning](images/axe-violation.png){.autodark}
:::

## Planned work: automated checks before publishing

Currently, this feature requires users to open the webpage in a [local preview](/docs/websites/index.html#website-preview), and it uses a CDN to load the `axe-core` library itself.

In the future, we envision a mode where every page of a website can be checked at the time of `quarto render` or `quarto publish` in order to reduce the amount of required manual intervention.
