## Overview

The Quarto Neovim plugin aims to not reinvent the wheel.
Existing plugins in the Neovim ecosystem are leveraged to provide the full experience.
Some of the features provided by [quarto-nvim](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-nvim) and enhanced by plugins found in the [kickstarter configuration](https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter) are:

-   Preview for Quarto documents.
-   Syntax highlighting for markdown and embedded languages
-   Completion for embedded languages (e.g. Python, R, Julia, etc.)
-   Commands and key-bindings for running cells and selected lines.
-   Completion for bibliography references, file paths, LaTeX math symbols, emoji.
-   Optional spellchecking and completion.
-   Code snippets.
-   Export of code chunks into standalone scripts.

### Installation

Installation instructions for the quarto plugin and the kickstarter configuration can be found in the respective readme files of the repository:

- [quarto-nvim](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-nvim)
- [quarto-nvim-kickstarter](https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter)

## Render and Preview

To render and preview, execute the **QuartoPreview** command by pressing `:` to enter command mode and typing the command (there is autocompletion if you press the <kbd>tab</kbd> key).
In the kickstarter configuration, there are more shortcuts starting with <kbd>space q</kbd> (spacebar followed by q, in normal mode).

After running the `QuartoPreview` command in Neovim, the preview will automatically update each time the buffer is saved.

## Running Code Cells

{{< include ../get-started/hello/_neovim-running-cells.md >}}

Here are all of the commands and keyboard shortcuts available for executing cells:

| Quarto Command       | Keyboard Shortcut   |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Create new terminal  | <kbd>space c _x_</kbd><br> where _x_ is the starting letter of python, r, ipython, julia or bash  |
| Choose terminal      | <kbd>space c c</kbd> |
| Show terminal id     | <kbd>space c s</kbd> |
| Run Current Cell     | <kbd>space Enter</kbd> |
| Run Current Cell     | <kbd>ctrl Enter</kbd> (insert or normal mode)^[if your terminal emulator supports this, see [Running Cells](/docs/get-started/hello/neovim.qmd#running-cells)] |
| Run Selected Line(s) | <kbd>Enter</kbd> (visual mode) |

Note that you can quickly insert a new code cell using the <kbd>Alt+I</kbd> and <kbd>Alt+Shift+I</kbd> keyboard shortcuts, the first being an R and the second being a python code chunk.
Feel free to change this from the kickstarter configuration depending on your most-used language.

## Contextual Assistance

In a code chunk you get autocompletion for the respective language.
Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> to iterate through the suggestions.

::: {.callout-note}
The otter in the completion list means that the completion plugin [cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) got its completion suggestions from the [otter.nvim](https://github.com/jmbuhr/otter.nvim) plugin, which keeps track of the code in your Quarto document behind the scenes by writing only the code parts to another (an otter) document.

## Code Snippets

Code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns (e.g. code blocks, callouts, divs, etc.).
You will find them in the autocompletion list and can trigger them with enter.
Sometimes they contain multiple places within the snippet where the cursor can jump to.
Use <kbd>ctrl+n</kbd> to jump to the next site.

For example, we might want to create a two column layout, so we type `col2` and accept the suggestion with <kbd>Enter</kbd> to get

```
::: {layout-ncol=2}

:::
```

## Document Navigation

Vim is famously good at letting you navigate documents quickly.
Here, we only have a look at some additional features provided by quarto-nvim.
For the full range of options, refer to the documentation of vim/neovim and of the plugins included in the kickstarter configuration.

- Press <kbd>space l o</kbd> to toggle a section overview
- Navigate to the next code chunk with <kbd>[c</kbd> or the previous one with <kbd>]c</kbd>
- Delete/Change/Yank the code of a chunk with <kbd>dio</kbd>/<kbd>cio</kbd>/<kbd>yio</kbd>
- Delete/Change/Yank a whole code chunk with its delimiters with <kbd>dao</kbd>/<kbd>cao</kbd>/<kbd>yao</kbd>

Take a look at the files of the kickstarter configuration for more inspiration.

## Extending Quarto: Lua Development in Neovim

Since Lua is already the language used to configure Neovim and the kickstarter configuration installs the Lua Language Server, code completion and diagnostics will be enabled for Quarto [extension development](/docs/extensions/index.qmd).
