title: VS Code Notebook Editor

In addition to editing Quarto documents as plain-text `.qmd` files, you can also use the VS Code Notebook Editor to author `.ipynb` notebooks that are rendered with Quarto. In this article we'll review the basics of editing `.ipynb` notebooks for use with Quarto.


## Render and Preview

The basic workflow for editing notebooks for use with Quarto is identical to the workfow for `.qmd` files. Edit the file and then execute the **Quarto: Preview** command (you can alternatively use the <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+K</kbd> keyboard shortcut). You'll see a preview of the published page side by side with the notebook:

![](images/vscode-notebook.png){.border}

After you've done an initial **Quarto: Preview**, the preview will automatically update every time you save the notebook.

## YAML Front Matter

The first cell of your notebook should be a **Raw** cell that contains the document title, author, and any other options you need to specify. Note that you can switch the type of a cell to **Raw** using the cell type menu at the bottom right of the cell:

![](images/vscode-raw.png){.border fig-alt="The top section of an ipynb file open in VSCode. There is a Raw cell containing yaml front matter."}

In this example we specify that we want code to appear collapsed by default. There are YAML options to control many other aspects of document rendering. See the documentation on [Authoring](../authoring/markdown-basics.qmd) and [Output Formats](../output-formats/html-basics.qmd) for additional details.

## Markdown Cells

Here's the underlying code for the markdown cell:

![](images/vscode-markdown.png){.border fig-alt="A snippet of an ipynb document containing a Markdown cell. The cell contains some text written in Markdown."}

Note that a Quarto cross-reference (`@fig-polar`) is included in the markdown. Any valid Pandoc markdown syntax can be included in markdown cells.

## Output Options

Quarto uses leading comments with a special prefix (`#|`) to denote cell options. Here we specify the `label` and `fig-cap` options so that the plot generated from the cell can be cross-referenced.

![](images/vscode-cell-options.png){.border fig-alt="A snippet of a JupyterLab document containing a code cell. At the top of cell, before the code, are the Quarto chunk options '#| label: fig-polar' and '#| fig-cap: A line plot on a polar axis.'"}

Note that options must appear at the very beginning of the cell. As with document front-matter, option names/values use YAML syntax.

There are many output options available, including options to optionally hide code, warnings, and/or output. See the documentation on [Output Options](../computations/execution-options.qmd#output-options) for additional details.

## Cell Execution

{{< include ../computations/_jupyter-execute.md >}}

There are many other execution options available (e.g. to control caching, optimizing kernel start-up time, etc.). Learn more about these options in [Execution Options](../computations/execution-options.qmd).

## Converting Notebooks

You can convert between .ipynb and .qmd representations of a notebook using the `quarto convert` command. For example:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto convert basics-jupyter.ipynb
quarto convert basics-jupyter.qmd
```

See `quarto convert help` for additional details on converting notebooks.
