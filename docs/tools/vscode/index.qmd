## Overview

Quarto can render Jupyter notebooks represented as plain text (`.qmd`) or as a normal notebook file (`.ipynb`). The [Quarto VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto) includes many tools that enhance working these documents, including:

-   Integrated render and preview for Quarto documents.
-   Syntax highlighting for markdown and embedded languages
-   Completion and diagnostics for YAML options
-   Completion for embedded languages (e.g. Python, R, Julia, etc.)
-   Commands and key-bindings for running cells and selected lines.
-   Live preview for LaTeX math as well as Mermaid and Graphviz diagrams

The Quarto extension integrates directly with the Jupyter, R, and Julia extensions. For example, here the Quarto extension runs a Python cell and shows contextual help for Python functions:

The second pane is the source code for a quarto file with python code. The third is interactive with Python running and output of the code cells shown."}

You can install the Quarto extension from the [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto) or the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/quarto/quarto).
