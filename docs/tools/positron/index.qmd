## Overview

Positron bundles both the Quarto CLI and the VS Code Quarto extension so it comes ready to work with Quarto out-of-the-box.

The [Quarto VS Code Extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/quarto/quarto) provides the support for Quarto in Positron, including:

-   Integrated render and preview for Quarto documents.
-   Syntax highlighting for markdown and embedded languages
-   Completion and diagnostics for YAML options
-   Completion for embedded languages (e.g. Python, R, Julia, etc.)
-   Commands and key-bindings for running cells and selected lines.
-   Live preview for LaTeX math as well as Mermaid and Graphviz diagrams

The Quarto extension integrates directly with Positron's native R and Python features.
For example, here the Quarto extension runs a Python cell in the active Python Console and shows a preview of an included image.

The third shows the Environment and Plots for the active console populated with the output of the code cells."}

The Quarto extension also works well with other extensions bundled with Positron, like Jupyter extension, and those you might install separately, like the Julia extension.
