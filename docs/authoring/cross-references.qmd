## Overview

Cross-references make it easier for readers to navigate your document by providing numbered references and hyperlinks to various entities like figures and tables. Every cross-referenceable entity requires a label---a unique identifier prefixed with a cross-reference type e.g. `#fig-element`. For example, this is a cross-referenceable figure:

``` markdown
![Elephant](elephant.png){#fig-elephant}
```

The presence of the label (`#fig-elephant`) makes this figure referenceable. This enables you to use the following syntax to refer to it elsewhere in the document:

``` markdown
See @fig-elephant for an illustration.
```

Here is what this would look like rendered to HTML:

![](images/crossref-figure.png){.border fig-alt="A line drawing of an elephant. The caption 'Figure 1: Elephant' is centered beneath it." width="100%"}

Note that cross reference identifiers must start with their type (e.g. `fig-` or `tbl-`). So the identifier `#fig-elephant` is valid for a cross-reference but the identifiers `#elephant` and `#elephant-fig` are not.

::: {#reserved-prefixes}
::: {.callout-warning}

## Reserved Prefixes 

Unless you are creating a cross-reference, avoid using the reserved cross-reference prefixes for code cell labels (e.g. set using the `label` code cell option) and element IDs (set using a `#` in an attribute). 
 
The reserved prefixes are: `fig`, `tbl`, `lst`, `tip`, `nte`, `wrn`, `imp`, `cau`, `thm`, `lem`, `cor`, `prp`, `cnj`, `def`, `exm`, `exr`, `sol`, `rem`, `alg`, `eq`, `sec`.

Also avoid using underscores (`_`) in labels and IDs as this can cause problems when rendering to PDF with LaTeX.

Quarto enables you to create cross-references to figures, tables, equations, sections, code listings, theorems, proofs, and more. Cross references can also be applied to dynamic output from Knitr and Jupyter. 

On this page you'll learn:

*  Different ways to use the `@` syntax to create [References](#references).
*  How to add [Lists](#lists) of references in LaTeX / PDF output.

Then, we enumerate the syntax for the different types of elements you might want to reference:

*  [Floats](#floats): [Figures](#figures), [Tables](#tables) and [Code Listings](#code-listings)
* Blocks: [Callouts](#callouts), [Theorems and Proofs](#theorems-and-proofs) and [Equations](#equations) 
*  [Sections](#sections)

There are options available that control the text used for titles and references. For example, you could change "Figure 1" to read "Fig 1" or "fig. 1". See the [options documentation](cross-reference-options.qmd) for details on how to customize the text used for cross-references.

## References

The examples on this page all use the default syntax for inline references (e.g. `@fig-elephant`), which results in the reference text "Figure 1", "Table 1", etc.

You can customize the appearance of inline references by either changing the syntax of the inline reference or by setting options. Here are the various ways to compose a cross-reference and their resulting output:

| Type          | Syntax                | Output   |
|---------------|-----------------------|----------|
| Default       | `@fig-elephant`       | Figure 1 |
| Capitalized   | `@Fig-elephant`       | Figure 1 |
| Custom Prefix | `[Fig @fig-elephant]` | Fig 1    |
| No Prefix     | `[-@fig-elephant]`    | 1        |

Note that the capitalized syntax makes no difference for the default output, but would indeed capitalize the first letter if the default prefix had been changed via an [option](cross-reference-options.qmd#references) to use lower case (e.g. "fig.").

These syntax variations work not only for Figures, but for all cross-referenceable elements in Quarto such as Tables, Equations, Theorems, and so on.

You can also group cross-references using the following syntax:

``` markdown
As illustrated in [@fig-elephant; @fig-panther; @fig-rabbit].
```

There are a number of options that can be used to further customize the treatment of cross-references. See the guide on [Cross Reference Options](cross-reference-options.qmd#references) for additional details.

## Lists

For LaTeX / PDF output, you can use the raw LaTeX commands `\listoffigures`, `\listoftables` and `\listoflistings` to produce listings of all figures, tables, etc. within a document. You can use the `lof-title`, `lot-title`, and `lol-title` crossref options to customize the title of the listing.

For example:

``` markdown
---
title: "My Document"
crossref:
  lof-title: "List of Figures"
format: pdf
---

\listoffigures
```

Note that the default titles for the lists use the form displayed above (i.e. "List of \<Type\>").

## Floats

[Figures](#figures), [tables](#tables) and [code listings](#code-listings) are known as "float" cross-references. Floats can appear in the rendered document at locations other than where they are defined, i.e. they float, and usually have captions. 

In addition to the compact syntax for the most common uses of float cross-references, you can also define float cross-references with a div syntax. Use the div syntax when you need more flexibility in the content of your cross-reference, for example, to have a [video](cross-references-divs.qmd#videos) be referenced as a figure. Basic examples of the div syntax are included in the sections below, but you can find more complicated examples in [Cross-Reference Div Syntax](cross-references-divs.qmd). 

You can also define custom types of float cross-reference to reference elements beyond figures, tables and code listings. Read more at [Custom Float Cross-References](cross-references-custom.qmd).


### Figures

As described on the Overview above, this is the markdown used to create a cross-referenceable figure and then refer to it:

``` markdown
![Elephant](elephant.png){#fig-elephant}

See @fig-elephant for an illustration.
```

Note again that cross-reference identifiers must start with their type (e.g. `#fig-`) and that cross-reference identifiers must be all lower case.

{{< include _cross-reference-divs-figure.qmd >}}

You can read about using div syntax with figures at [Cross-Reference Div Syntax](cross-references-divs.qmd#figures).

#### Subfigures

You may want to create a figure composed of multiple subfigures. To do this, enclose the figures in a div (with its own label and caption) and give each subfigure its own label and (optionally) caption. You can then refer to either the entire figure in a reference or a single subfigure:

``` markdown
::: {#fig-elephants layout-ncol=2}

![Surus](surus.png){#fig-surus}

![Hanno](hanno.png){#fig-hanno}

Famous Elephants
:::

See @fig-elephants for examples. In particular, @fig-hanno.
```

Here is what this looks like when rendered as HTML:

![](images/crossref-subfigures.png){.preview-image .border fig-alt="An artistic rendition of Surus, Hannibal's last war elephant, is on the left. Underneath this picture is the caption '(a) Surus.' On the right is a line drawing of Hanno, a famous elephant. Underneath this picture is the caption '(b) Hanno.' The words 'Figure 1: Famous elephants' are centered beneath both pictures. The text 'See fig. 1 for examples. In particular, fig. 1(b).' is underneath this text and is aligned to the left." width="100%"}

Note that we also used the `layout-ncol` attribute to specify a two-column layout. See the article on [Figures](figures.qmd) for more details on laying out panels of figures.

#### Computations

Figures produced by Jupyter and Knitr can also be cross-referenced. To do this, add a `label` and `fig-cap` option at the top of the code block. For example:

::: panel-tabset
##### Jupyter

    ```{{python}}
    #| label: fig-plot
    #| fig-cap: "Plot"

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.plot([1,23,2,4])
    plt.show()
    ```

    For example, see @fig-plot.

![](images/crossref-figure-jupyter.png){fig-alt="A line plot with the label 'Figure 1: Plot' centered underneath it. The text 'For example, see fig. 1' is underneath this label and aligned to the left."}

##### Knitr

    ```{{r}}
    #| label: fig-plot
    #| fig-cap: "Plot"

    plot(cars)
    ```

    For example, see @fig-plot.

![](images/crossref-figure-r.png){fig-alt="A scatter plot of speed versus distance for the `cars` dataset. The label 'Figure 1: Plot' is centered beneath it. The text 'For example, see fig. 1' is aligned to the left underneath that."}
:::

{{< include _computed-caption.md >}}

You can also create multiple figures within a code cell and reference them as subfigures. To do this use `fig-cap` for the main caption, and `fig-subcap` to provide an array of subcaptions. For example:

    ```{{python}}
    #| label: fig-plots
    #| fig-cap: "Plots" 
    #| fig-subcap:
    #|   - "Plot 1"
    #|   - "Plot 2" 
    #| layout-ncol: 2

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.plot([1,23,2,4])
    plt.show()

    plt.plot([8,65,23,90])
    plt.show()
    ```

    See @fig-plots for examples. In particular, @fig-plots-2.

![](images/crossref-subfigures-jupyter.png){fig-alt="Two line plots side-by-side. The plot on the left has the caption '(a) Plot 1' centered underneath it. The plot on the right has the caption '(b) Plot 2' centered underneath it. The text 'Figure 1: Plots' is centered underneath both of these plots. The text 'See fig. 1 for examples. In particular, fig. 1(b)' is aligned to the left underneath that."}

Note that subfigure reference labels are created automatically based on the main chunk label (e.g. `@fig-plots-1`, `@fig-plots-2`, etc.).

If you'd like subfigure captions that include only an identifier, e.g. "(a)", and not a text caption, then specify `fig-subcap: true` rather than providing explicit subcaption text:

```{{python}}
#| label: fig-plots
#| fig-cap: "Plots" 
#| fig-subcap: true
#| layout-ncol: 2
```

### Tables

{{< include _table-crossrefs.md >}}

::: callout-important
## Label Prefix

In order for a table to be cross-referenceable, its label must start with the `tbl-` prefix.
:::

{{< include _cross-reference-divs-table.qmd >}}

You can read more about using div syntax with tables at [Cross-Reference Div Syntax](cross-references-divs.qmd#tables).

#### Subtables

{{< include _table-crossrefs-subtables.md >}}

#### Computations

You can also cross-reference tables created from code executed via computations. To do this, add the `label` and `tbl-cap` cell options. For example:

```{{r}}
#| label: tbl-iris
#| tbl-cap: "Iris Data"

library(knitr)
kable(head(iris))
```

![](/docs/authoring/images/crossref-table-knitr.png){fig-alt="Example table output." fig-align="center" width="80%"}

{{< include _computed-caption.md >}}

You can also create multiple tables within a code cell and reference them as subtables. To do this, add a `tbl-subcap` option with an array of subcaptions. For example:

```{{r}}
#| label: tbl-tables
#| tbl-cap: "Tables"
#| tbl-subcap:
#|   - "Cars"
#|   - "Pressure"
#| layout-ncol: 2

library(knitr)
kable(head(cars))
kable(head(pressure))
```

![](/docs/authoring/images/crossref-subtable-knitr.png){fig-alt="Two tables side-by-side. Each table has 2 columns and 8 rows. The table on the left is titled '(a) Cars'. The table on the right is titled '(b) Pressure'. Centered underneath both tables is the text 'Table 1: Tables.'" fig-align="center" width="80%"}

If you'd like subtable captions that include only an identifier, e.g. "(a)", and not a text caption, then specify `tbl-subcap: true` rather than providing explicit subcaption text:

```{{r}}
#| label: tbl-tables
#| tbl-cap: "Tables"
#| tbl-subcap: true
#| layout-ncol: 2

library(knitr)
kable(head(cars))
kable(head(pressure))
```

![](/docs/authoring/images/crossref-subtable-nocaption-knitr.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}


### Code Listings

To create a reference-able code block, add a `#lst-` identifier along with a `lst-cap` attribute. For example:

```` markdown
```{#lst-customers .sql lst-cap="Customers Query"}
SELECT * FROM Customers
```

Then we query the customers database (@lst-customers).
````

{{< include _cross-reference-divs-listing.qmd >}}

You can read more about using div syntax for code listings in [Cross-Reference Div Syntax](cross-references-divs.qmd).

{{< include _cross-references-listings.qmd >}}

## Callouts

{{< include _cross-references-callouts.qmd >}}

## Theorems and Proofs

Theorems are commonly used in articles and books in mathematics. To include a reference-able theorem, create a div with a `#thm-` label (or one of other theorem-type labels described below). You also need to specify a theorem name either via the first heading in the block. You can include any content you like within the div. For example:

``` markdown
::: {#thm-line}

## Line

The equation of any straight line, called a linear equation, can be written as:

$$
y = mx + b
$$
:::

See @thm-line.
```

![](images/crossref-theorem.png){fig-alt="A snippet of a LaTeX document. The first line reads: 'Thereom 1 (Line) The equation of any straight line, called a linear equation, can be written as:' Cenetered on a separate line is the equation 'y = mx + b'. The text 'See thm. 1' is aligned to the left underneath that."}

For LaTeX output, the [amsthm](https://ctan.org/pkg/amsthm?lang=en) package is used for typesetting theorems. For other formats an appropriate treatment is used (the above is an example of HTML output).

There are a number of theorem variations supported, each with their own label prefix:

| **Label Prefix** | **Printed Name** | **LaTeX Environment** |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| `#thm-`          | Theorem          | theorem               |
| `#lem-`          | Lemma            | lemma                 |
| `#cor-`          | Corollary        | corollary             |
| `#prp-`          | Proposition      | proposition           |
| `#cnj-`          | Conjecture       | conjecture            |
| `#def-`          | Definition       | definition            |
| `#exm-`          | Example          | example               |
| `#exr-`          | Exercise         | exercise              |
| `#sol-`          | Solution         | solution              |
| `#rem-`          | Remark           | remark                |
| `#alg-`          | Algorithm        | algorithm             |

The `proof` environment receives similar typesetting as theorems, however it is not numbered (and therefore cannot be cross-referenced). To create a proof add the `.proof` class to a div:

``` markdown
::: {.proof}
By induction.
:::
```

As with theorems you can optionally include a heading as the first element of the div (or a `name` attribute) to give the environment a caption for typesetting (this typically appears in parentheses after the environment title).

For LaTeX output the [amsthm](https://ctan.org/pkg/amsthm?lang=en) package is used to typeset these environments. For other formats a similar treatment is used, but you can further customizing this using CSS.

## Equations

Provide an `#eq-` label immediately after an equation to make it referenceable. For example:

``` markdown
Black-Scholes (@eq-black-scholes) is a mathematical model that seeks to explain the behavior of financial derivatives, most commonly options:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathrm C}{ \partial \mathrm t } + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} \mathrm S^{2}
\frac{\partial^{2} \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm S^2}
  + \mathrm r \mathrm S \frac{\partial \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm S}\ =
  \mathrm r \mathrm C 
$$ {#eq-black-scholes}
```

Black-Scholes (@eq-black-scholes) is a mathematical model that seeks to explain the behavior of financial derivatives, most commonly options:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathrm C}{ \partial \mathrm t } + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} \mathrm S^{2}
\frac{\partial^{2} \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm S^2}
  + \mathrm r \mathrm S \frac{\partial \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm S}\ =
  \mathrm r \mathrm C 
$$ {#eq-black-scholes}

Note that the equation number is included (via `\qquad`) in the right margin of the equation.

## Sections

To reference a section, add a `#sec-` identifier to any heading. For example:

``` markdown
## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

See @sec-introduction for additional context.
```

Note that when using section cross-references, you will also need to enable the `number-sections` option (so that section numbering is visible to readers). For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
number-sections: true
---
```
