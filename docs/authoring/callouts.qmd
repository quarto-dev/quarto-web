title: Callout Blocks
format: html

Callouts are an excellent way to draw extra attention to certain concepts, or to more clearly indicate that certain content is supplemental or applicable to only some scenarios.

## Callout Types

There are five different types of callouts available.

-   `note`
-   `warning`
-   `important`
-   `tip`
-   `caution`

The color and icon will be different depending upon the type that you select. Here are what the various types look like in HTML output:

::: callout-note
Note that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.
:::

::: callout-warning
Callouts provide a simple way to attract attention, for example, to this warning.
:::

::: callout-important
## This is Important

Danger, callouts will really improve your writing.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Tip With Caption

This is an example of a callout with a caption.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'collapsed' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.

## Markdown Syntax

Create callouts in markdown using the following syntax (note that the first markdown heading used within the callout is used as the callout heading):

``` markdown
::: {.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip With Caption

This is an example of a callout with a caption.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
:::
```

## Customizing Appearance

### Collapse

You can create 'folded' callouts that can be expanded by the user by settings the `collapse` attribute on the callout. If you set `collapse=true`, the callout will be expandable, but will be collapsed by default. If you set `collapse=false`, the callout will be expanded, but will be expanded by default.

### Appearance

Callouts have 3 different looks you can use.

|           |                                                                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default` | The default appearance with colored header and an icon.                                                         |
| `simple`  | A lighter weight appearance that doesn't include a colored header background.                                   |
| `minimal` | A minimal treatment that applies borders to the callout, but doesn't include a header background color or icon. |

You can set the callout appearance either globally in the document (or project yaml):

``` yaml
callout-appearance: simple
```

or by setting the `type` attribute on the callout. For example

``` markdown
::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Pay Attention

Using callouts is an effective way to highlight content that your reader give special consideration or attention.

:::
```

which appears as:

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

### Icons

In addition to controlling the appearance of the callout, you can also choose to directly suppress the icon by setting the global option in your document (or project) yaml:

``` yaml
callout-icon: false
```

or by setting an attribute directly on the callout:

``` markdown
::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Pay Attention

Which will appear as:

## Format Support

The following formats render callouts as illustrated above:

-   HTML
-   PDF
-   MS Word
-   EPUB

Note that callout rendering for HTML is not available when you disable the standard HTML theme (e.g. if you specify the `theme: none` option).

When the target format doesn't support callouts, they are rendered as a simple blockquote with the caption in bold.
