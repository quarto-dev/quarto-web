## Overview

You can include the output of an external Jupyter notebook in a Quarto document with the `embed` shortcode. To embed a notebook cell, provide the path to a Jupyter Notebook and a cell identifier. For example, this notebook called `penguins.ipynb` has a cell labelled `fig-bill-scatter`:

![](images/notebook-simple.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of a Jupyter Notebook with the name 'penguins.ipynb', with a cell highlighted that has the code chunk option label set to fig-bill-scatter. Below the cell is the resulting plot."}

You can use the following shortcode to embed the output of this cell:

```{.markdown shortcodes=false}
{{< embed penguins.ipynb#fig-bill-scatter >}}
```

This will embed the plot as follows:

{{< embed penguins.ipynb#fig-bill-scatter >}}

A link to the source notebook is automatically provided beneath the plot. Following the link takes users to a rendered version of the notebook, allowing them to explore the notebook without having to download and run it locally. For example, clicking on the link to `penguins.ipynb` gets you to a page that looks like the following:

![](images/notebook-view.png){.border fig-alt="A screenshot of webpage with the title 'penguins.ipynb', a large blue button labelled 'Download Notebook', followed by the notebook contents."}

Beyond this basic usage, you can also:

-   Specify cells in multiple ways, see [Specifying Cells](#specifying-cells).

-   Control the output using code cell options in the source Notebook, including things like figure captions, figure layout, and code display, see [Code Cell Options](#code-cell-options).

-   Include the cell code along with the output by adding an `echo` option to the shortcode, see [Embedding Code](#embedding-code).

-   Customize or exclude the link to the the source notebooks, see [Links to Source Notebooks](#linked-source-notebooks).

## Specifying Cells {#specifying-cells}

The `embed` shortcode specifies target notebooks using a relative path followed by a cell identifier (e.g. `penguins.ipynb#fig-bill-scatter`). If the cell identifier is omitted, all of the cells in the notebook will be embedded in the document.

The cell identifier is used to locate the proper cell using the following heuristics:

1.  **Cell `id`**\
    First, the cell metadata will be checked for a matching `id`. ([Cell IDs](https://jupyter.org/enhancement-proposals/62-cell-id/cell-id.html) are a newer feature of Jupyter Notebooks that are not yet well supported in Jupyter front ends, but `id` is checked first to allow for future compatibility as they become more common).
2.  **Label**\
    If no cell with a matching `id` is found, Quarto will use a cell that has a `label` in the code metadata which matches the cell identifier.
3.  **Tags**\
    If no cell has been found, Quarto will use a cell or cell(s) whose tag matches the cell identifier.

### Cell Tags

For example, to embed the output of a cell that you have given the tag `bill-ratio` within Jupyter Lab:

![](images/notebook-tag.png){.border fig-alt="Screenshot of a code cell in a Jupyter Notebook with the cell tags open in the cell toolbar and displaying the tag 'bill-ratio'."}

You would use the following embed:

```{.markdown shortcodes=false}
{{< embed penguins.ipynb#bill-ratio >}}
```

Which results in the following output:

{{< embed penguins.ipynb#bill-ratio >}}

## Code Cell Options {#code-cell-options}

Code cell options from the source Jupyter Notebook are propagated to the document in which they are embedded. For instance, you may specify code cell options like `fig-cap`, `fig-alt` and `layout-ncol`, to control aspects of embedded figures. For example, this cell in the Notebook specifies figure options including a caption, sub-caption, alt text and layout:

```{.python filename="penguins.ipynb"}
#| label: fig-bill-marginal
#| fig-cap: "Marginal distributions of bill dimensions"
#| fig-subcap: 
#|   - "Gentoo penguins tend to have thinner bills,"
#|   - "and Adelie penguins tend to have shorter bills."
#| fig-alt:
#|   - "Density plot of bill depth by species."
#|   - "Density plot of bill length by species."
#| layout-ncol: 2

sns.displot(penguins, 
            x = "bill_depth_mm", 
            hue = "species", 
            kind = "kde", fill = True, aspect = 2, height = 3)
plt.show()
sns.displot(penguins, 
            x = "bill_length_mm", 
            hue = "species", 
            kind = "kde", fill = True, aspect = 2, height = 3)
plt.show()
```

When this cell is embedded:

```{.markdown shortcodes=false}
{{< embed penguins.ipynb#fig-bill-marginal >}}
```

The following output is produced:

{{< embed penguins.ipynb#fig-bill-marginal >}}

## Embedding Code {#embedding-code}

You may include the code from a cell along with the output by using the `echo=true` option. For example, to include the code and the plot from the cell labelled `species-counts` the embed would be:

```{.markdown shortcodes=false}
{{< embed penguins.ipynb#species-counts echo=true >}}
```

The result in the document is both the code and output for the cell:

{{< embed penguins.ipynb#species-counts echo=true >}}

Like figure options, options for displaying the code will propagate from the source Jupyter Notebook. For example, to fold the code for this cell, you could add `code-fold: true` to the options for the `species-counts` cell:

```{.python filename="penguins.ipynb"}
#| label: species-counts
#| code-fold: true
penguins.groupby("species").size().reset_index(name = "count")
```

The options set in the YAML header for the document in which these cells are embedded will also control these code cells. For example, to fold all the code, including the code embedded from `penguins.ipynb`, you could add `code-fold: true` to the document YAML:

```{.yaml filename="sample.qmd"}
title: Exploration of penguin characteristics
author: Norah Jones
toc: true
format:
  html:
    code-fold: true
```

## Links to Source Notebooks {#linked-source-notebooks}

When you embed the contents of Notebooks in a Quarto document and render the document to HTML, Quarto will automatically include links to the source Notebooks that provided the embedded content. These links will by default appear both inline below the embedded content as well as below the table of contents. For example, the following document embeds content from the notebook `penguins.ipynb`. You can see the links in the rendered HTML document below:

![](images/notebook-links.png){.border fig-alt="Screenshot of a rendered page with an embedded plot. A link to the Source 'penguins.ipynb' is shown directly below the plot. A similar link is shown below the table of contents under the heading 'Notebooks'."}

### Link Placement

You can control the placement of the links to source notebooks by specifying the option `notebook-links`{spellcheck="false"} in the document YAML with one of the following values:

`true`{spellcheck="false"} (default)

:   Display links to source notebooks inline below the embedded content, and alongside the table of contents.

`false`{spellcheck="false"}

:   Do not display any links to source notebooks.

`inline`{spellcheck="false"}

:   Display only the links inline below the embedded content.

`global`{spellcheck="false"}

:   Display only the links alongside the table of contents. 

### Notebook Views

By default, the link to the source notebook goes to an automatically generated HTML render of the notebook. This makes it easier for users to view the Notebook contents without needing to download and run the Notebook locally. This notebook view displays the contents of the notebook and includes a button to download the notebook.  For example:

![](images/notebook-view.png){.border fig-alt="A screenshot of webpage with the title 'penguins.ipynb', a large blue button labelled 'Download Notebook', followed by the notebook contents."}

As an example, you can view the [live preview for the \`penguins.ipynb\` notebook](penguins.ipynb.html) used in this document.

### View Options

You can control the behavior of notebook views using `notebook-view`. For each source notebook, you can provide a `title` and a `url`. The `title` will be used as the text of the any links to the source notebook and will also appear at the top of the rendered notebook view. The `url`, if provided, will be used as the `href` of any links to the source notebook. This is useful if you have deployed a copy of the source notebook to a site like Github, Google Colab, or Kaggle and would rather link to that instead.

For example:

``` {.markdown style="whitespace: pre-wrap;"}
notebook-view:
  - notebook: penguins.ipynb
    title: "Plots and Computations"
    url: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12GsIPQ644SI4vkEEHiZn-Qqfbr-bD1__
```

will result in links to the source notebook like so:

![](images/notebook-links-updated.png){.border fig-alt="Screenshot of a rendered page with an embedded plot. A link to the Source 'Plots and Computations' is shown directly below the plot. A similar link is shown below the table of contents under the heading 'Notebooks'."}

To disable the notebook views, and instead link directly to the Jupyter notebook (so the user may download the notebook with no intermediary view), set `notebook-view` to `false`.
