## Overview

In this tutorial we'll show you how to author Quarto documents in RStudio.
In particular, we'll discuss the various document formats you can produce with the same source code and show you how to add components like table of contents, equations, citations, etc.
The [visual markdown editor](/docs/visual-editor/index.qmd) in RStudio makes many of these tasks easier so we'll highlight its use in this tutorial, but note that it's possible to accomplish these tasks in the source editor as well.

If you would like to follow along step-by-step in your own environment, install the [latest release](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) of RStudio.

## Output Formats

Quarto supports rendering notebooks to dozens of different output formats.
By default, the `html` format is used, but you can specify an alternate format (or formats) within document options.

### Format Options

You can choose the format you want to render your Quarto document to at the time of creating your new document.
To create a new document, go to **File** \> **New File** \> **Quarto Document...** Alternatively, use the command palette (accessible via Ctrl+Shift+P), search for **Create a new Quarto document** and hit return.

In the **Title** field, give a title for your document (e.g. the screenshot below suggests "Housing Prices") and add your name to the **Author** field.
Next, you will select the output format for your document.
By default, RStudio suggests using HTML as the output, let's leave that default for now.

![](images/rstudio-new-document.png){.border fig-alt="Pop up menu for creating a new document. The title field shows that we entered \"Housing Prices\" and the author field shows the name \"Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel\". HTML format is selected via the radio button. All else is left as default choices (e.g., Engine is Knitr and the Use visual markdown editor checkbox is checked)." fig-align="center" width="600"}

A new document will be created with the following YAML.

``` yaml
---
title: "Housing Prices"
author: "Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel"
---
```

Note that our format choice (HTML) is not even reflected in the YAML as it is the default output format for Quarto documents.
However you can directly edit the YAML to change the output format, e.g. to PDF (`pdf`) or MS Word (`docx`).
Add `format: pdf` to your document's YAML as shown below.

``` yaml
---
title: "Housing Prices"
author: "Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel"
format: pdf
---
```

Unfortunately, this document has no content, so rendering it would not result in very interesting output.
To make it a bit easier to demonstrate all the features we want to highlight in this tutorial, let's close this empty document and start with one that has a little bit of content in it.
If you would like to follow along step-by-step in your own environment, download the Quarto document (`.qmd`) below and open it in RStudio.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
<i class="bi bi-download"></i> [Download authoring.qmd](_authoring.qmd){download="authoring.qmd"}
:::

{{< include _install-tinytex.md >}}

See the article on [PDF Engines](/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.qmd) for details on using other LaTeX distributions and PDF compilation engines.

Once you have LaTeX setup, click on <kbd>![](images/rstudio-render-button.png){width="25" height="20"}</kbd> **Render** (or use the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘K).
We recommend also checking the box for **Render on Save** for a live preview of your changes.
As shown below, you should see the rendered PDF in the Viewer in RStudio.

![](images/rstudio-pdf-preview.png){.border .column-page-right fig-alt="RStudio with authoring.qmd open. On the left: Source code in the visual editor. On the left: Rendered document as a PDF in the Viewer."}

Next, let's add an option to the YAML, e.g. to add line numbers to the code chunks (`code-line-numbers: true`).
Add this option to your document's YAML as shown below, paying attention to the indentation scheme.
Under `format:` our format choice `pdf` is indented (with two spaces) and it's followed by `:` to indicate that further options for that format will be specified.
In the next line, further indented by two spaces, we add `code-line-numbers: true`.

``` yaml
---
title: "Housing Prices"
author: "Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel"
format:
  pdf:
    code-line-numbers: true
---
```

If you checked **Render on Save** earlier, just save the document after making this change for a live preview.
Otherwise render the document to see your updates reflected, including a table of contents that looks like the following.

![](images/rstudio-code-line-numbers.png){.border fig-alt="Rendered version of authoring.qmd as PDF, with line numbers next to each of the lines of code chunks." fig-align="center"}

An incredibly exciting format option that we won't go into too much detail in this tutorial is `revealjs`.
Yes, you can make presentations with Quarto as well!
In fact, Quarto supports a variety of formats for creating presentations, including `revealjs` for HTML slides, `pptx` for PowerPoint, and `beamer` for LaTeX/PDF.
The [Presentations](/docs/presentations/index.qmd) article gives a thorough walk through of creating slide decks with Quarto.

### Multiple Formats

Some documents you create will have only a single output format, however in many cases it will be desirable to support multiple formats.
Let's add the `html` and `docx` formats to our document and modify some options specific to each format.

``` yaml
---
title: "Housing Prices"
author: "Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel"
highlight-style: pygments
format:
  html: 
    code-fold: true
    html-math-method: katex
  pdf:
    geometry: 
      - top=30mm
      - left=30mm
  docx: default
---
```

There's a lot to take in here!
Let's break it down a bit.
The first two lines are generic document metadata that aren't related to output formats at all.

``` yaml
---
title: "Housing Prices"
author: "Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel"
---
```

The next line is a document format option that *applies to all formats*, which is why it is specified at the root level.

``` yaml
---
highlight-style: pygments
---
```

Next, we have the `format` option, where we provide format-specific options.

``` yaml
---
format:
  html: 
    code-fold: true
    html-math-method: katex
  pdf:
    geometry: 
      - top=30mm
      - left=30mm
  docx: default
---
```

The `html` and `pdf` formats each provide an option or two.
For example, for the HTML output we want the user to have control over whether to show or hide the code (`code-fold: true`) and use `katex` for math text.
For PDF we define some margins.
The `docx` format is a bit different---it specifies `docx: default`.
This indicates that we just want to use all of the default options for the format.

## Rendering

Clicking the <kbd>![](images/rstudio-render-button.png){width="25" height="21"}</kbd> **Render** button (or using the keyboard shortcut <kbd>⇧⌘K</kbd>) in RStudio will render the document to the first format listed in the YAML.

![](images/rstudio-html-preview.png){.border fig-alt="Rendered version of authoring.qmd as HTML. There is no table of contents and the code chunks are folded, hiding the code."}

Note that the <kbd>![](images/rstudio-render-button.png){width="25" height="21"}</kbd> **Render** button also has a drop down menu that enables you to render to any of the formats listed in YAML front matter:

![](images/rstudio-render-formats.png){.border}

If you would like to render to all formats, you can do so with the [**quarto**](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-r) package, which provides an R interface to the Quarto CLI. For example, to render the current document, use `quarto::quarto_render()`.
You can also specify the name of the document you want to render as well as the output format(s).

``` r
quarto::quarto_render(
  "authoring.qmd", 
  output_format = c("pdf", "html", "docx")
)
```

As a result, you will see three new files appear in your Files pane:

-   `authoring.docx`
-   `authoring.html`
-   `authoring.pdf`

![](images/rstudio-files-pane.png){.border fig-alt="RStudio Files pane, with four document, all titled authoring, but with different suffixes: docx, html, pdf, qmd." fig-align="center" width="600"}

## Sections

You can use a table of contents and/or section numbering to make it easier for readers to navigate your document.
Do this by adding the `toc` and/or `number-sections` options to document options.
Note that these options are typically specified at the root level because they are shared across all formats.

``` yaml
---
title: "Housing Prices"
author: "Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel"
toc: true
number-sections: true
highlight-style: pygments
format:
  html: 
    code-fold: true
    html-math-method: katex
  pdf:
    geometry: 
      - top=30mm
      - left=30mm
  docx: default
---
```

Here's what this document looks like when rendered to HTML.

![](images/rstudio-toc-secnum.png){.border fig-alt="Rendered version of authoring.qmd as HTML with numbered sections and a table of contens on the top right. The table of contents shows three sections: Introduction, Exploratory data analysis (with subsections Data visualization and Summary statistics), and Modeling."}

There are lots of options available for controlling how the table of contents and section numbering behave.
See the output format documentation (e.g. [HTML](/docs/output-formats/html-basics.qmd), [PDF](/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.qmd), [MS Word](/docs/output-formats/ms-word.qmd)) for additional details.

## Equations

If you are using the visual editor mode, you can add LaTeX equations to Quarto documents in RStudio using the [Insert Anything](/docs/visual-editor/index.qmd#insert-anything) tool.
You can access it with <kbd>/</kbd> at the beginning of an empty block or <kbd>Cmd+/</kbd> anywhere else.

![](images/rstudio-insert-equation.png){.border fig-alt="Insert anything tool in the RStudio visual editor being used to insert a display math." fig-align="center" width="600"}

Display equations (in a new line) are delimited with `$$…$$` while inline equations are delimited with `$…$`.
Add the following as display math in the document.

``` markdown
price = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \times area + \epsilon
```

RStudio displays a rendered version of the tutorial as you type it in the editor.
See the documentation on [markdown equations](/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.qmd#equations) for additional details.

![](/docs/get-started/authoring/images/rstudio-equation-render.png){.border}

## Citations

The Insert Anything tool can also be used to insert citations to your document.

![](images/rstudio-insert-citation.png){fig-alt="Using the visual editor insert citation tool." width="700"}

In the next window you can insert a citation via from a variety of sources including your document bibliography, [Zotero](/docs/visual-editor/technical.qmd#citations-from-zotero) personal or group libraries, [DOI](/docs/visual-editor/technical.qmd#citations-from-dois) (Document Object Identifier) references, and searches of [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/), [DataCite](https://datacite.org/), or [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
You can find out more about citations with the visual editor [here](/docs/visual-editor/technical.qmd#citations).

Select **From DOI** on the left and copy-and-paste the DOI [`10.1093/comjnl/27.2.97`](https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/27.2.97) in the search bar and hit **Search**.
Then, select the found reference, and **Insert** it into your document.

![](images/rstudio-insert-citaton-menu.png){fig-alt="Insert citation to Knuth, D's Literate Programming article via DOI."}

If this is the first citation you are adding to your document, RStudio will automatically create a bibliography file for you.
This file is called `references.bib` by default and RStudio will also add `bibliography: references.bib` to your document's YAML metadata.

Note that items within the bibliography are cited using the `@citeid` syntax.
Add the following text to your document.

``` markdown
We're going to do this analysis using literate programming [@knuth1984].
```

References will be included at the end of the document, so we include a `## References` heading at the bottom of the notebook.
You might also add `.unnumbered` class to this section by clicking on the three dots (<kbd>...</kbd>) to edit its attributes.

![](images/rstudio-references-section.png){.border fig-alt="Edit Attributes window for the section title References. The image shows that this menu can be accessed by cliking on the three dots." width="700"}

Here is what this document looks like when rendered (with middle sections removed to highlight the relevant parts.

![](images/rstudio-references.png){.border fig-alt="Document with a single citation and a references section at the end."}

The `@` citation syntax is very flexible and includes support for prefixes, suffixes, locators, and in-text citations.
See the documentation on [Citations](/docs/authoring/citations.qmd) to learn more.

## Cross References

Cross-references make it easier for readers to navigate your document by providing numbered references and hyperlinks to figures, tables, equations, and sections.
Cross-reference-able entities generally require a label (unique identifier) and a caption.

For example, to add a label to the equation inserted earlier, click on the three dots to edit its attributes and use the suggested format (starting with `#eq-`) to label the equation.

![](images/rstudio-crossref-equation.png){.border fig-alt="Add label to an equation using the visual editor. The label added is #eq-slr."}

Then, add a cross reference using the Insert Anything tool in the visual editor.
You might add a sentence like `"We can fit a simple linear regression model of the form shown in"` to contextualize the cross reference and then add the reference to the end of that sentence.

![](images/rstudio-crossref-equation-insert.png){.border fig-alt="Use the insert anything tool in the visual editor to insert a cross reference."}

In the Insert Cross Reference menu, navigate to the desired cross reference entity on the left, and select the equation labeled earlier.

![](images/rstudio-crossref-insert-menu.png){.border fig-alt="Use the insert cross reference menu, select Equations on the left side, and select an equation to cross reference."}

Alternatively, start typing the label of the equation to be referenced in the visual editor, and the autofill tool will bring up the cross references to choose from.

![](images/rstudio-crossref-eq-autofill.png){.border fig-alt="Cross reference an equation by starting to type out its label."}

Below we illustrate cross-referencing various types of entities using fragments from the document you've been working with.

``` markdown
We present the results of exploratory data analysis in @sec-eda and the regression model in @sec-model.


@fig-scatterplot displays the relationship between these two variables in a scatterplot.


@tbl-stats displays basic summary statistics for these two variables.


We can fit a simple linear regression model of the form shown in @eq-slr.
```

This examples include cross-referenced sections, figures, and equations.
The table below summarizes how we express each of these.

See the article on [Cross References](/docs/authoring/cross-references.qmd) to learn more, including how to customize caption and reference text (e.g. use "Fig." rather than "Figure").

## Callouts

Callouts are an excellent way to draw extra attention to certain concepts, or to more clearly indicate that certain content is supplemental or applicable to only some scenarios.

Callouts are markdown divs that have special callout attributes.
We can insert a callout using the Insert Anything tool.

![](images/rstudio-insert-callout.png){.border fig-alt="Insert Anything tool to insert a callout."}

In the subsequent dialogue you can select one of five types of callout (note, tip, important, caution, or warning), customize its appearance (default, simple, or minimal), and decide whether you want to show the icon.

![](images/rstudio-callout-dialogue.png){.border fig-alt="Callout dialogue. Type note is selected with default appearance and show icon box is checked." fig-align="center" width="500"}

Then, try inserting the following text in the callout box.

``` markdown
This is a pretty incomplete analysis, but hopefully the document provides a good overview of some of the authoring features of Quarto!
```

Here is what a callout looks like in the visual editor.

![](images/rstudio-callout-note-source.png){.border fig-alt="Callout box in the visual editor. Callout text reads \"This is a pretty incomplete analysis, but hopefully the document provides a good overview of some of the authoring features of Quarto!\""}

And here is the rendered callout in the output document.

![](images/rstudio-callout-note-rendered.png){.border fig-alt="Callout box in the rendered HTML document. Callout text reads \"This is a pretty incomplete analysis, but hopefully the document provides a good overview of some of the authoring features of Quarto!\""}

You can learn more about the different types of callouts and options for their appearance in the [Callouts](/docs/authoring/callouts.qmd) documentation.

## Article Layout

The body of Quarto articles have a default width of approximately 700 pixels.
This width is chosen to [optimize readability](https://medium.com/ben-shoemate/optimum-web-readability-max-and-min-width-for-page-text-dee9987a27a0).
This normally leaves some available space in the document margins and there are a few ways you can take advantage of this space.

We can use the `column: page-right` cell option to indicate we would like our figure to occupy the full width of the screen, with some inset.
Go ahead and add this chunk option to the chunk labeled `fig-histogram`.

``` r
#| label: fig-histogram
#| fig-cap: "Histograms of individual variables"
#| fig-subcap:
#|   - "Histogram of `price`s"
#|   - "Histogram of `area`s" 
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page-right
```

Here is what the relevant section of the document looks like when rendered.

![](images/rstudio-column-page-right-render.png){.border fig-alt="Rendered version of authoring.qmd as HTML. Exploratory data analysis section is shown, the side-by-side histograms span a width wider than the rest of the document."}

You can locate citations, footnotes, and asides in the margin.
You can also define custom column spans for figures, tables, or other content.
See the documentation on [Article Layout](/docs/authoring/article-layout.qmd) for additional details.

## Publishing

Once your document is rendered to HTML, you can publish to [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/) (a free service from RStudio for sharing documents on the web) simply by clicking the <kbd>![](images/rstudio-publish-button.png){width="25" height="23"}</kbd> Publish button on the editor toolbar or preview window.
Alternatively, you can use the `quarto::quarto_publish_doc()` function.

``` r
quarto::quarto_publish_doc(
  "authoring.qmd", 
  server = "rpubs.com"
  )
```

Other possible publishing options include RStudio Connect and ShinyApps as well as GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.
The [Publishing HTML](/docs/output-formats/html-publishing.qmd) article gives a much more detailed overview of your publishing options.

If you followed along step-by-step with this tutorial, you should now have a Quarto document that implements everything we covered.
Otherwise, you can download a completed version of `computations.qmd` below.
