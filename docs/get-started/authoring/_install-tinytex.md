## LaTeX Required for `format: pdf`

In order to create PDFs you will need to install a recent distribution of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
We recommend the use of TinyTeX (which is based on TexLive), which you can install with the following command:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto install tinytex
```
