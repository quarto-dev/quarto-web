This dataset contains a subset of the fuel economy data from the EPA.

```{python}
#| label: load-packages
from plotnine import *
from plotnine.data import mpg
```

The visualization below shows a positive, strong, and linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of these cars.
Additionally, mileage is higher for cars with fewer cylinders.

```{python}
#| label: scatterplot
(
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x="hwy", y="cty", color="cyl"))
    + geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=2)
    + scale_color_continuous()
    + theme_bw()
)
```
