@fig-scatterplot shows a positive, strong, and linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of these cars.
Additionally, mileage is higher for cars with fewer cylinders.

```{r}

#| fig-cap: City and highway mileage for 38 popular models of cars.
#| fig-alt: Scatterplot of city vs. highway mileage for cars, where points are colored by the number of cylinders. The plot displays a positive, linear, and strong relationship between city and highway mileage, and mileage increases as the number of cylinders decreases.
