This dataset contains a subset of the fuel economy data from the EPA.
Specifically, we use the `mpg` dataset from the **ggplot2** package.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| echo: false

library(ggplot2)
```

The visualization below shows a positive, strong, and linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of these cars.
Additionally, mileage is higher for cars with fewer cylinders.

```{r}
#| label: scatterplot

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal()
```
