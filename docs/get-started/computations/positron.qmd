## Overview

Quarto supports executable code cells within markdown.
This allows you to create fully reproducible documents and reports---the code required to produce your output is part of the document itself, and is automatically re-run whenever the document is rendered.

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to author fully reproducible computational documents with Quarto in Positron.

You'll learn how to:

-   Run code cells interactively in the Console

-   Control code output, including hiding code

-   Control figure output including captions and layout

-   Add new code cells and get help with code cell options

-   Use values from your code cells in markdown text


## Setup 

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"} 

## R

1.  Be sure that you have installed the `tidyverse` package:

    ``` r
    install.packages("tidyverse")
    ```

2.  Download `computations.qmd` below and open it in Positron.

    ::: {.callout appearance="minimal"}
    <i class="bi bi-download"></i> [Download computations.qmd](_positron/r/computations.qmd){download="computations.qmd"}
    :::

3.  Run the **Quarto: Preview** command, use the keyboard shortcut {{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-K win=Ctrl+Shift+K linux=Ctrl+Shift+K >}}, or use the **Preview** button (![](/docs/tools/images/vscode-preview-icon.svg){.light-content fig-alt="Preview icon"}![](/docs/tools/images/vscode-preview-icon-white.svg){.dark-content fig-alt="Preview icon"}) in the editor toolbar, to render and preview the document.

    ![](images/positron-setup-r.png){.column-page-right fig-alt="Positron with `computations.qmd` open in the Editor. The document is being previewed in the Viewer."}

## Python

1.  Install the `jupyter` and `plotnine` packages using your preferred method. For example, with `pip`:

    ``` bash 
    pip install jupyter plotnine
    ```

2.  Download `computations.qmd` below and open it in Positron.

    ::: {.callout appearance="minimal"}
    <i class="bi bi-download"></i> [Download computations.qmd](_positron/python/computations.qmd){download="computations.qmd"}
    :::

3.  Run the **Quarto: Preview** command, use the keyboard shortcut {{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-K win=Ctrl+Shift+K linux=Ctrl+Shift+K >}}, or use the **Preview** button (![](/docs/tools/images/vscode-preview-icon.svg){.light-content fig-alt="Preview icon"}![](/docs/tools/images/vscode-preview-icon-white.svg){.dark-content fig-alt="Preview icon"}) in the editor toolbar, to render and preview the document.

    ![](images/positron-setup-python.png){.column-page-right fig-alt="Positron with `computations.qmd` open in the Editor. The document is being previewed in the Viewer."}

:::

## Cell Execution

As you author a document you may want to execute one or more code cells without re-rendering the entire document.
You can do this using the **Run Cell** button above the code cell.
Click the button, run the command **Quarto: Run Cell**, or use the shortcut {{< kbd mac=Cmd-Shift-Enter win=Ctrl+Shift+Enter linux=Ctrl+Shift+Enter >}}, to execute the current cell in the Console:

:::{.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

![](images/positron-run-cell-r.png){.border fig-alt="Positron with `computations.qmd` open in Editor centered on a code cell with the label `load-packages`. The Console is open, showing the output of running the code in the code cell."}

## Python 

![](images/positron-run-cell-python.png){.border fig-alt="Positron with `computations.qmd` open in Editor centered on a code cell with the label `load-packages`. The Console is open, showing the output of running the code in the code cell."}

:::

In addition to running a single code cell, there are a variety of other commands and keyboard shortcuts available:

| Quarto Command       | Keyboard Shortcut |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Run Cell             | {{< kbd mac=Cmd-Shift-Enter win=Ctrl+Shift+Enter linux=Ctrl+Shift+Enter >}} |
| Run Current Code     | {{< kbd mac=Cmd-Enter win=Ctrl+Enter linux=Ctrl+Enter >}} |
| Run Next Cell        | {{< kbd mac=Cmd-Option-N win=Ctrl+Alt+N linux=Ctrl+Alt+N >}} |
| Run Previous Cell    | {{< kbd mac=Cmd-Option-P win=Ctrl+Alt+P linux=Ctrl+Alt+P >}} |
| Run Cells Above      | {{< kbd mac=Cmd-Option-Shift-P win=Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P linux=Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P >}} |
| Run Cells Below      | {{< kbd mac=Cmd-Option-Shift-N win=Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N linux=Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N >}} |
| Run All Cells        | {{< kbd mac=Cmd-Option-R win=Ctrl+Alt+R linux=Ctrl+Alt+R >}} |

::: {.callout-tip}

## Tracking down code problems

A good approach to trouble-shooting the code in your document
is to restart your Console ({{< kbd mac=Cmd-Shift-0 windows=Ctrl+Shift+0 linux=Ctrl+Shift+0 >}}), and **Quarto: Run All Cells** ({{< kbd mac=Cmd-Option-R win=Ctrl+Alt+R linux=Ctrl+Alt+R >}}). 
This emulates Quarto's approach to executing the code in your document: starting a clean session, and executing code cells from top to bottom. 

:::

## Cell Output

By default, the code and its output are displayed within the rendered document.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

![](images/positron-code-echo-true-r.png){.border  fig-alt="Positron Viewer pane with a document titled Quarto Computations that contains some text, code and a visualization."}

## Python

![](images/positron-code-echo-true-python.png){.border  fig-alt="Positron Viewer pane with a document titled Quarto Computations that contains some text, code and a visualization."}

:::


However, for some documents, you may want to hide all of the code and just show the output.
To do so, specify `echo: false` in document header.

``` yaml
---
title: "Quarto Computations"
echo: false
---
```

Preview again to see your updates reflected.
The result will look like the following.

![](images/positron-code-echo-false-r.png){.border  fig-alt="Positron Viewer pane with a document titled Quarto Computations that contains some text, and a visualization. No code is shown."}

You might want to selectively enable code `echo` for some cells.
To do this add the `echo: true` option to a code cell.
Try this with the cell labelled `scatterplot`.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

``` r
#| label: scatterplot
#| echo: true

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  theme_bw()
```

## Python 

``` python
#| label: scatterplot
#| echo: true

(
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x="hwy", y="cty", color="cyl"))
    + geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=2)
    + scale_color_continuous()
    + theme_bw()
)
```
:::



Preview the document again and note that the code is now included for the `scatterplot` cell.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

![](images/positron-code-echo-cell-r.png){.border  fig-alt="Positron Viewer pane with a document titled Quarto Computations that contains some text, and a visualization. Code is shown for plot, but not package loading."}

## Python

![](images/positron-code-echo-cell-python.png){.border  fig-alt="Positron Viewer pane with a document titled Quarto Computations that contains some text, and a visualization. Code is shown for plot, but not package loading."}

:::

The `echo` option controls whether the source code itself is shown in the rendered document.
Other options control the display of other aspects of code cells. 
Like `echo` they can be set in the document header or overridden in code cells:

-  `output`: show output of the code like figures, tables, text output, etc. (default `true`)
-  `warning`: show warnings produced by the code  (default `true`)
-  `include`: show anything, a catch-all for the code itself, output, and warnings (default `true`)
-  `eval`: whether to execute the code or not (default `true`)
-  `error`: whether execution should continue after an error and the error should be displayed (default `false`)

You can read more about these options in [Execution options](/docs/computations/execution-options.qmd).


## Code Appearance

There are lots of other options to tweak the appearance of code in your document. 
For example, an alternative to showing or hiding code is to use [code folding](/docs/output-formats/html-code.qmd#folding-code).


::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

``` r
#| label: scatterplot
#| code-fold: true

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  theme_bw()
```

## Python 

``` python
#| label: scatterplot
#| code-fold: true

(
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x="hwy", y="cty", color="cyl"))
    + geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=2)
    + scale_color_continuous()
    + theme_bw()
)
```
:::

Code cells in the rendered document are placed under a collapsed "Code" button, which readers can expand at their discretion.

![](images/positron-code-fold-r.png){.border fig-alt="Part of a rendered Quarto document with the title Quarto Computations. The document contains two code cells that are folded, with a button to expand them."}

As another example, you can add line numbers to your code cells with the `code-line-numbers`:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

``` r
#| label: scatterplot
#| code-line-numbers: true

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  theme_bw()
```

## Python 

``` python
#| label: scatterplot
#| code-line-numbers: true

(
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x="hwy", y="cty", color="cyl"))
    + geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=2)
    + scale_color_continuous()
    + theme_bw()
)
```
:::

The options available for code cells depend on the engine used to execute the code cells.
You can read more about how Quarto chooses an engine in [Engine Binding](/docs/computations/execution-options.qmd#engine-binding).

:::{.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R 

If you completed this tutorial with R, you'll have been using the `knitr` engine. 
See [Knitr Cell Options](/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.qmd) documentation for the complete list of available code cell options.

## Python
If you completed this tutorial with Python, you'll have been using the `jupyter` engine.
See the [Jupyter Cell Options](/docs/reference/cells/cells-jupyter.qmd) documentation for the complete list of available code cell options.

:::

Many code cell options can also be set in the document header to apply the option to all code cells.
For instance, you could fold all code cells in the document by adding the `code-fold` option to the document header:

```yaml
---
title: "Quarto Computations"
format: 
  html:
    code-fold: true
---
```

To understand which options can be set in the document header, look at the [Reference](/docs/reference) for the format you are using.
For instance, `code-fold` can be set in the document header because it is listed as an [HTML format option](/docs/reference/formats/html.qmd).

You can see examples of other options that control code appearance in the HTML format in the Guide page [HTML Code Blocks](/docs/output-formats/html-code.qmd).

## Figures

Figures produced by code cells are automatically included in the rendered output.
Code cell options provide additional control over how figures are displayed. 

For example, update the code cell for the scatter plot by adding a caption with `fig-cap`, and improve accessability by adding [alternative text](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81) with `fig-alt`:

```yml
#| fig-cap: "City and highway mileage for 38 popular models of cars."
#| fig-alt: "Scatterplot of city vs. highway mileage for cars, where points are colored by the number of cylinders. The plot displays a positive, linear, and strong relationship between city and highway mileage, and mileage increases as the number of cylinders decreases."
```

To [cross-reference](/docs/authoring/cross-references.qmd#computations) a figure replace the `label` with one that that starts with `fig-`:

```yml
#| label: fig-scatterplot
```

Then you can update the narrative to refer to the figure using its label:

``` markdown
@fig-scatterplot shows a positive, strong, and linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of these cars.
```

Preview the document to see the plot now has a caption and an automatically generated number, which is linked from the text.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

![](images/positron-figure-r.png){.border .column-page-right fig-alt="Positron with `computations.qmd` open. On the right is the Editor. Compared to earlier images on the page, the code cell shows the added fig-cap and fig-alt options. On the right is the rendered version of the document. Below the figure is a caption."}

## Python

![](images/positron-figure-python.png){.border .column-page-right fig-alt="Positron with `computations.qmd` open. On the right is the Editor. Compared to earlier images on the page, the code cell shows the added fig-cap and fig-alt options. On the right is the rendered version of the document. Below the figure is a caption."}

::: 

You can control the size of all the figures in the document by setting `fig-width` and `fig-height`, expressed in inches, in the document header:

``` yaml
---
title: "Quarto Computations"
fig-height: 3.5
fig-width: 6
---
```

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

To override the figure size for individual images, use the `fig-width` and `fig-height` options as code cell options:

```r
#| label: fig-scatterplot
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 3.5
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  theme_bw()
```

## Python 

To override the figure size for individual images, specify the plot size in your code. For example, in `plotnine` you can use `figure_size` argument to `theme()`:

```python
(
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x="hwy", y="cty", color="cyl"))
    + geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=2)
    + scale_color_continuous()
    + theme_bw() 
    + theme(figure_size=(6, 3.5))
)
```

:::

Quarto provides lots of additional flexibility for figures. 

You can:

*  Produce figure panels with multiple figures, each with its subcaption. 
See the article [Figure Layout](/docs/authoring/figures.qmd#figure-panels) for details.

*  Allow figures to span the page or screen, or place them in the margin. See the documentation on [Article Layout](/docs/authoring/article-layout.qmd) to learn more.

## Cell Workflow

You can add a new code cell by running the command **Quarto: Insert Code Cell**, using the keyboard shortcut {{< kbd mac=Cmd-Shift-I win=Ctrl+Shift+I linux=Ctrl+Shift+I >}}, or using the **Insert Code Cell** button in the editor toolbar.

Since, `.qmd` documents are plain text, you can also create a new code cell by typing (or copying and pasting) the code cell syntax:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

````markdown
```{{r}}

```
````

## Python

````markdown
```{{python}}

```
````

:::   

Go ahead and add a new code cell to your document after the scatter plot cell.

To get help with code cell options, start by writing the code cell option comment (`#| `), then hit {{< kbd mac=Ctrl-Space win=Ctrl+Space linux=Ctrl+Space >}} to bring up a list of completions. 
Keep typing to filter the list, or use the arrow keys to navigate.
When you find the option you want, hit {{< kbd mac=Enter win=Enter linux=Enter >}} to insert it into your code cell.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

![](images/positron-cell-option-completion-r.png){.border fig-alt="Positron Editor with a code cell option comment. The user has typed `#| ` followed by `e` and the code completion menu is open, showing available options including `echo`, `error`, `eval` and `expandable`."}

## Python

![](images/positron-cell-option-completion-python.png){.border fig-alt="Positron Editor with a code cell option comment. The user has typed `#| ` followed by `e` and the code completion menu is open, showing available options including `echo`, `error`, `eval` and `expandable`."}

:::

Practice this to add `echo: true` to your code cell, and `label: nobs`.

Finally, add some code to the cell.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

```r
nrow(mpg)
```

## Python

```python
len(mpg)
```

:::

Preview the document again to see the output of your code cell. 
This isn't a very pretty way to display the number of observations.
An alternative is to use inline code, which we'll cover next.

::: {.callout-tip}

## Code blocks

Code cells using the `` ```{language} `` syntax are sometimes called *executable* code cells because they will be executed by the computational engine (e.g. `knitr` or `jupyter`).

If you want to show code without it being processed by the computational engine use a code block:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

````markdown
```r
# Code goes here
```
````

## Python

````markdown
```python
# Code goes here
```
````

:::

You can read more, and see some syntax alternatives, at [Markdown Basics: Source Code](/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.qmd#source-code)

:::

## Inline Code

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

To include executable expressions within markdown text, enclose the expression in `` `{r} ` ``^[Quarto also supports the Knitr syntax `` `r ` ``, read more in [Inline Code](/docs/computations/inline-code.qmd)].

## Python

To include executable expressions within markdown, enclose the expression in `` `{python} ` ``.

::: 

For example, we can use inline code to state the number of observations in our data.
Try adding the following markdown text to your Quarto document.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

````markdown
There are `{r} nrow(mpg)` observations in our data.
````

## Python

````markdown
There are `{python} len(mpg)` observations in our data.
````

::: 

Save your document and preview the rendered output.
The expression inside the backticks has been executed and the sentence includes the actual number of observations.

::: {.border .p-3}
There are 234 observations in our data.
:::

You could now delete the code cell that did the same computation, since the inline code expression has replaced it.

If the expression you want to inline is more complex, involving many functions or a pipeline, we recommend including it in a code cell (with `echo: false`) and assigning the result to an object.
Then, you can call that object in your inline code.

For additional details on inline code expressions, visit the [Inline Code](/docs/computations/inline-code.qmd) page.
