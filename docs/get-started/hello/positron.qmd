## Overview

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that weaves together code and narrative to produce high-quality documents, presentations, websites, and more.
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Positron with Quarto.

Positron comes ready to work with Quarto out-of-the-box --- it includes both the Quarto command line interface and the [Quarto VS Code extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/quarto/quarto). 

It includes many tools that enhance working with Quarto, including:

-   Integrated render and preview for Quarto documents

-   Completion and diagnostics for Quarto options

-   Positron's full R and Python support for code that is inside a Quarto document, including interactive execution of code in the Console, code completion, help, and diagnostics.

Here's a sample Quarto document, `hello.qmd`, open in Positron, demonstrating the seamless side-by-side editing and preview experience:

On this page, you'll learn:

* The basic edit, then preview, workflow for Quarto documents in Positron.

* The three components a Quarto document---header, code cells, and markdown---and how they combine to produce a rendered output.

## Setup

If you would like to follow along with this tutorial in your own environment, follow the steps outlined below.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"} 

## R

1.  Be sure that you have installed the `tidyverse` and `palmerpenguins` packages:

    ``` r
    install.packages("tidyverse")
    install.packages("palmerpenguins")
    ```

2.  Download the Quarto document (`hello.qmd`) below and open it in Positron.

    ::: {.callout appearance="minimal"}
    <i class="bi bi-download"></i> [Download hello.qmd](_positron/r/hello.qmd){download="hello.qmd"}
    :::

## Python

1.  Install the `jupyter` and `plotnine` packages using your preferred method. For example, with `pip`:

    ``` bash 
    pip install jupyter plotnine
    ```

2.  Download the Quarto document (`hello.qmd`) below and open it in Positron.

    ::: {.callout appearance="minimal"}
    <i class="bi bi-download"></i> [Download hello.qmd](_positron/python/hello.qmd){download="hello.qmd"}
    :::

:::


## Basic Workflow

Quarto documents with the extension `.qmd` are a plain text format and will open in Positron's Editor pane.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"} 

## R

![](images/positron-editor-r.png){.column-page-right .border fig-alt="Positron with a file called `hello.qmd` open in the Editor." fig-align="center"}

## Python

![](images/positron-editor-python.png){.column-page-right .border fig-alt="Positron with a file called `hello.qmd` open in the Editor." fig-align="center"}

:::

To preview the document, execute the **Quarto: Preview** command.
You can alternatively use the keyboard shortcut {{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-K win=Ctrl+Shift+K linux=Ctrl+Shift+K >}}, or the **Preview** button (![](/docs/tools/images/vscode-preview-icon.svg){.light-content fig-alt="Preview icon"}![](/docs/tools/images/vscode-preview-icon-white.svg){.dark-content fig-alt="Preview icon"}) in the editor toolbar:

![](images/positron-editor-toolbar.png){.border fig-alt="The top of the Positron code editor. The left side of the editor tab area includes a Preview button."}

Quarto will process the document, and the output will preview in the Viewer pane.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"} 

## R

![](images/positron-hello-r.png){.column-page-right .border fig-alt="Positron with a Quarto document titled \"Penguins, meet Quarto!\" open on the left side and the rendered version of the document on the right side." fig-align="center"}

## Python

![](images/positron-hello-python.png){.column-page-right .border fig-alt="Positron with a Quarto document titled \"Penguins, meet Quarto!\" open on the left side and the rendered version of the document on the right side." fig-align="center"}

:::

The preview will update whenever you rerun the **Quarto: Preview** command.
For example, change the section heading `## Meet the penguins` to `## Meet the Palmer penguins` and rerun the **Quarto: Preview** command.
The preview in the Viewer will update to reflect the change.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"} 

## R

![](images/positron-update-r.png){.column-page-right .border fig-alt="Positron with `hello.qmd` open in the Editor, and a preview open in the Viewer. The Editor shows a markdown section updated to 'Meet the Palmer penguins', the Viewer shows the same updated section title." fig-align="center"}

## Python

![](images/positron-update-python.png){.column-page-right .border fig-alt="Positron with `hello.qmd` open in the Editor, and a preview open in the Viewer. The Editor shows a markdown section updated to 'Meet the Palmer penguins', the Viewer shows the same updated section title." fig-align="center"}

:::

If you prefer the preview to update whenever you save the document, you can check the **Render on Save** box in the editor toolbar.

## Rendering

The document, `hello.qmd`, is a combination of markdown and executable code cells.
Quarto uses the term *render* to describe the process of taking this source document and producing a new file that combines the output from the executed code cells with the markdown.
When `hello.qmd` is rendered, the new output is `hello.html`, an [HTML](/docs/output-formats/all-formats.qmd) document, but it could be a [PDF](/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.qmd), [MS Word](/docs/output-formats/ms-word.qmd) document, [presentation](/docs/presentations/index.qmd), [website](/docs/websites/website-basics.qmd), [book](/docs/books/book-basics.qmd), [interactive document](/docs/interactive/index.qmd), or [other format](/docs/output-formats/all-formats.qmd).

This is the basic model for Quarto publishing---take a source document that combines code and narrative, and render it to a variety of output formats.

The **Quarto: Preview** command encompasses two actions: rendering the document, and previewing the resulting file.
HTML and PDF formats will open in Positron's Viewer pane resulting in a side-by-side preview.
Other formats, like MS Word, will open externally.

You can also render the document without previewing it by executing the **Quarto: Render Document** command. 

::: {.callout-tip}

## Quarto is a command line tool

When you run the **Quarto: Preview** command, you will notice the Terminal executes `quarto preview`:

![](images/positron-terminal.png){.border fig-alt="The Positron Terminal pane showing the command 'quarto preview hello.qmd'."}

The Quarto extension provides Positron commands as convenient alternatives to running `quarto` commands in the Terminal, but you can also run the commands directly if you prefer.

## Authoring

Let's turn our attention to the contents of our Quarto document.
The file contains three types of content: a header, executable code cells, and markdown text.

### Document header

At the top of the file is the document header demarcated by three dashes (`---`) on either end:

``` yaml
---
title: Hello, Quarto
format: html
---
```

Inside the header, document-level options are specified using YAML.
The basic syntax of YAML uses key-value pairs in the format `key: value`.

In this case, the `title` is set to `"Hello, Quarto"` and the `format` is set to `html`.
When rendered, the `title`, will appear at the top of the rendered document with a larger font size than the rest of the document.
The `format` field denotes the target format for the output.

Other options commonly found in headers of documents include metadata like `author`, `subtitle`, and `date`, as well as customizations like `theme`, `fontcolor`, `fig-width`, etc.
The available options depend on the output format and are listed in the [Reference](/docs/reference) e.g.: [HTML options](/docs/reference/formats/html.qmd), [PDF options](/docs/reference/formats/pdf.qmd) and [MS Word options](/docs/reference/formats/docx.qmd).

### Code cells

Code cells contain executable code to be run during render, with the output (and optionally the code) included in the rendered document.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

Code cells are identified with `{r}`:

```` markdown
```{{r}}
#| label: load-packages
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```
````

## Python 

Code cells are identified with `{python}`:

```` markdown
```{{python}}
#| label: load-packages
#| include: false
from plotnine import *
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins

penguins = load_penguins()
```
````

::: 

Code cell options are set at the top of a code cell using special comments that start with `#|`.
The options themselves are specified using YAML syntax.
In this case, the `label` of the code cell is `load-packages`, and `include` is set to `false` to indicate that neither the code nor any of its outputs should appear in the rendered document.
There are a wide variety of code cell options you can apply to tailor your output, you can learn more in the next tutorial on [Computations](../computations/positron.qmd).

In addition to rendering the complete document to view the results of code cells, you can also run each code cell interactively.
Use the command: **Quarto: Run Cell**, the keyboard shortcut ({{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-Enter win=Control+Shift+Enter linux=Control+Shift+Enter >}}), or click Run Cell directly above the cell in the Editor. 
Positron executes the code in the Console and displays the results.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R 

![](images/positron-run-cell-r.png){.column-page-right fig-alt="A Positron session with `hello.qmd` open in the Editor. An orange box highlights the button 'Run Cell' above a code cell with the label `plot-penguins`. The Console shows an executed line of code ending in `theme_minimal()` and the Plots pane shows a scatterplot of penguin flipper and bill length." fig-align="center"}

## Python

![](images/positron-run-cell-python.png){.column-page-right fig-alt="A Positron session with `hello.qmd` open in the Editor. An orange box highlights the button 'Run Cell' above a code cell with the label `plot-penguins`. The Console shows an executed line of code ending in `theme_minimal()` and the Plots pane shows a scatterplot of penguin flipper and bill length." fig-align="center"}

::: 


### Markdown text

Narrative content is written using markdown. 
For example, the following excerpt includes a section heading (`## heading`), text formatted as code (`` `code` ``) and a link (`[text](url)`):

```markdown
## Meet the Palmer penguins

The `penguins` data from the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins) package contains...
```

Quarto supports markdown syntax for basic text formatting, tables, and images, as well as advanced features like citations, cross-references, and equations.

## How it works

:::{.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

When you render a Quarto document, first [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) executes all of the code cells and creates a new markdown (.md) document, which includes the code and its output.

The markdown file generated is then processed by [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), which creates the finished format.

![](images/rstudio-qmd-how-it-works.png){.border fig-alt="Workflow diagram starting with a qmd file, then knitr, then md, then pandoc, then PDF, MS Word, or HTML."}

## Python

When you render a Quarto document, first [jupyter](https://jupyter.org) executes all of the code cells and creates a new markdown (.md) document, which includes the code and its output.

The markdown file generated is then processed by [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), which creates the finished format.

## R or Python? Does it matter?

When a Quarto document includes executable code cells, 
Quarto uses what is known as an *engine* to execute them.
If you're following along with this tutorial with R, you have been using the `knitr` engine. 
If you're following along with Python, you have been using the `jupyter` engine.
You can read more about how Quarto chooses an engine in [Engine Binding](/docs/computations/execution-options.qmd#engine-binding).

Quarto supports other languages in addition to R and Python for code cells like [Julia](/docs/computations/julia.qmd) (via the `julia` engine or the `jupyter` engine) and [Observable JS](/docs/computations/ojs.qmd).
