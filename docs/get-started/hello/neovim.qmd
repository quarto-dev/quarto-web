## Overview

In this tutorial we'll show you how to use Quarto with Neovim. While we cover the basics here, you will also want to review the article on [Using Neovim with Quarto](/docs/tools/neovim.qmd) to learn more about installing, using, and customizing Neovim for Quarto. 

If you already have Neovim configured to your liking, you may only want to add the [quarto-nvim](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-nvim) plugin and only refer to this guide for inspiration and seeing the possibilities.
But if you are entirely new to Neovim or want to simply try out a configuration already set up for data science with Quarto, you should head over to this [kickstarter configuration](https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter).
This is also what we will be using for this tutorial.

::: callout-note
Neovim is a highly customizable editor.
So much so that Neovim core member TJ Devries has recently coined the term Personal Development Environments (PDE)^[In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVIJhC9Veg)] to separate the concept from Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as VS Code and RStudio.

Out of the box neovim is fairly minimal.
To work efficiently and get all the nice features, you have to configure it.
You have to make it your own.
If this approach sounds enticing to you, read on.
Welcome to the rabbit hole. 🐰

You can also watch [this video](https://youtu.be/3sj7clNowlA) for a quick guide to getting started with the kickstarter configuration alongside this write-up.

{{< video https://youtu.be/3sj7clNowlA >}}

The Quarto Neovim plugin aims to not reinvent the wheel.
Existing plugins in the Neovim ecosystem are leveraged to provide the full experience.
Some of the features provided by `quarto-nvim` and enhanced by plugins found in the kickstarter configuration are:

-   Preview for Quarto documents.
-   Syntax highlighting for markdown and embedded languages
-   Completion for embedded languages (e.g. Python, R, Julia, etc.)
-   Commands and key-bindings for running cells and selected lines.
-   Completion for bibliography references, file paths, LaTeX math symbols, emoji.
-   Optional spellchecking and completion.
-   Code snippets.
-   Export of code chunks into standalone scripts.

See the article on [Using Neovim with Quarto](/docs/tools/neovim.qmd) for all of the details.

### Basic Workflow

Quarto `.qmd` files contain a combination of markdown and executable code cells.
Here's what it might look like in Neovim to edit and preview a `.qmd` file:

![](./images/neovim-overview.png){.border fig-alt="Three windows arranged side by side. The window on the left is a qmd file opened in Neovim. The upper window on the right is a web browser. The contents of the qmd document are rendered by Quarto in the browser window. The third window is a rendered graph showing the output of executing a code chunk in the qmd file."}

The document on the right is *rendered* into the HTML version you see on the left.
This is the basic model for Quarto publishing---take a source document and render it to a variety of [output formats](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html), including HTML, PDF, MS Word, etc.

The tutorials will make use of the `matplotlib` and `plotly` Python packages---the commands you can use to install them are given in the table below.

+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Platform  | Commands                                            |
+===========+=====================================================+
|           | ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}                      |
| Mac/Linux | python3 -m pip install jupyter matplotlib plotly    |
|           | ```                                                 |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
|           | ```{.powershell filename="Terminal"}                |
| Windows   | py -m pip install jupyter matplotlib plotly         |
|           | ```                                                 |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+

::: callout-note
Note that while this tutorial uses Python, using Julia (via the [IJulia](https://julialang.github.io/IJulia.jl/stable/) kernel) or using R (via the [knitr package](https://github.com/yihui/knitr)), are also well supported.
See the articles on [Using Julia](/docs/computations/julia.qmd) and [Using R](/docs/computations/r.qmd) for additional details.

## Render and Preview

We'll start out by rendering a simple example (`hello.qmd`) to a couple of formats.
If you want to follow along step-by-step in your own environment, create a new file named `hello.qmd` and copy the following content into it.

```` markdown
---
title: "Quarto Basics"
format:
  html:
    code-fold: true
jupyter: python3
---

For a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.

```{{python}}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r);
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]);
ax.grid(True);
plt.show()
```
````

To render and preview, execute the **QuartoPreview** command by pressing `:` to enter command mode and typing the command (there is autocompletion if you press the <kbd>tab</kbd> key).
In the kickstarter configuration, there are more shortcuts starting with <kbd>space q</kbd> (spacebar followed by q, in normal mode).

### How it Works

When you render a `.qmd` file with Quarto, the executable code blocks are processed by Jupyter, and the resulting combination of code, markdown, and output is converted to plain markdown.
Then, this markdown is processed by [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), which creates the finished format.

![](images/qmd-how-it-works.png){alt="" fig-alt="Workflow diagram starting with a qmd file, then Jupyter, then md, then pandoc, then PDF, MS Word, or HTML." fig-align="left"}

### Authoring

Let's try making a small change and then re-rendering:

1.  Change the line of code that defines `theta` as follows:

    ``` python
    theta = 4 * np.pi * r
    ```

2.  Save the file using either `:w` in normal mode or `ctrl-s` ^[if you are using the kickstarter configuration -- otherwise `ctrl-s` puts your terminal in a waiting mode until you press `ctrl+q`, which can be confusing]

The document is rendered, and the browser preview is updated.
This is the basic workflow for authoring with Quarto.

### Running Cells

{{< include _neovim-running-cells.md >}}

There are few different types of content in `hello.qmd`, let's work a bit with each type.

## YAML Options

At the top of the file there is a YAML block with document level options.

``` yaml
---
title: "Quarto Basics"
format:
  html:
    code-fold: true
jupyter: python3
---
```

Try changing the `code-fold` option to `false`:

``` yaml
format: 
  html:
    code-fold: false
```

Then re-render the document by saving it.
You'll notice that the code is now shown above the plot, where previously it was hidden with a **Code** button that could be used to show it.

Narrative content is written using markdown.
Here we specify a header and a cross-reference to the figure created in the code cell below.

``` markdown
## Polar Axis

For a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.
```

Try changing the header and re-rendering---the preview will update with the new header text.

## Code Cells

Code cells contain executable code to be run during render, with the output (and optionally the code) included in the rendered document.

```` markdown
```{{python}}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
````

You are likely familiar with the Matplotlib code given here.
However, there are some less familiar components at the top of the code cell: `label` and `fig-cap` options.
Cell options are written in YAML using a specially prefixed comment (`#|`).

In this example, the cell options are used to make the figure cross-reference-able.
Try changing the `fig-cap` and/or the code then re-rendering to see the updated preview.

There are a wide variety of [cell options](/docs/reference/cells/cells-jupyter.qmd) that you can apply to tailor your output.
We'll delve into these options in the next tutorial.

::: callout-note
One particularly useful cell option for figures is `fig-alt`, which enables you to add alternative text to images for users with visual impairments.
See Amy Cesal's article on [Writing Alt Text for Data Visualization](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81) to learn more.
