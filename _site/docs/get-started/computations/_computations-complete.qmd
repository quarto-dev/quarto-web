There are `r nrow(mpg)` observations in our data.

```{r}
#| echo: false

mean_cty <- round(mean(mpg$cty), 2)
mean_hwy <- round(mean(mpg$hwy), 2)
```

The average city mileage of the cars in our data is `r mean_cty` and the average highway mileage is `r mean_hwy`.

The plots in Figure @fig-mpg show the relationship between city and highway mileage for 38 popular models of cars.
In Figure @fig-mpg-1 the points are colored by the number of cylinders while in Figure @fig-mpg-2 the points are colored by engine displacement.
