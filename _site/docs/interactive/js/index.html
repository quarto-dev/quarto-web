<p>Quarto supports JavaScript natively, enabling you to easily create interactive documents. In this example adapted <a href="https://observablehq.com/@berkeleyvis/crossfilter">from John Alexis Guerra Gómez</a>, we create three histograms showing the distribution of attributes from Allison Horst’s <a href="https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/">Palmer Penguins dataset</a>:</p>
<div class="cell" data-fig.cap="Histograms of measurements from the Palmer Penguin dataset. Brush regions to change selections.">

</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>FIXME: I need to rewrite this example so the code we show to users is clear; I like having a crossfilter example, but the observable code we’re using needs to be cleaned up.</strong></p>
<p>Quarto provides support for this through a dialect of JavaScript developed by <a href="https://www.observablehq.com">Observable</a>. The visualization part is created here using JavaScript and some libraries:</p>
