<p>Quarto Extensions are a powerful way to modify or extend the behavior of Quarto, and can be created and distributed by anyone. There are three types of extensions available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="../../../../docs/extensions/shortcodes.html">Shortcodes</a> are special markdown directives that generate various types of content. For example, you could create shortcodes to embed tweets or videos in a document.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="../../../../docs/extensions/filters.html">Filters</a> are a flexible and powerful tool for introducing new global behaviors and/or new markdown rendering behaviors. For example, you could create filters to implement output folding, an image carousel, or just about anything you can imagine!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="../../../../docs/extensions/formats.html">Formats</a> enable you to create new output formats by bundling together document options, templates, stylesheets, and other content.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Extensions are a recently released Quarto feature so you should be sure to install the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/">very latest version</a> of Quarto (at least v1.0.36) if you want to try them out.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of extensions developed and maintained by the core Quarto team:</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 30%">
<col style="width: 70%">

<section id="workshops" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="workshops">Workshops</h2>
<p>We will have two Quarto workshops at the conference, held on July 25-26, one for those who have no or little prior experience with R Markdown and the other for those who want to take their R Markdown skills and expertise and apply them in Quarto.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/workshops/get-started-quarto/"><strong>Getting Started with Quarto</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This workshop is designed for those who have no or little prior experience with R Markdown. In this 2 day workshop you will learn about the Quarto format for technical communication and computation. The workshop will teach you how to get started creating and fully customizing Quarto outputs (HTML, PDF, Presentations) and the use of RStudio’s Visual Editor which provides a user interface for editing all of Pandoc markdown. The workshop will also provide an overview of Quarto’s developer tooling support in alternative tools such as Jupyter, VS Code, and any text editors. The workshop will briefly cover how to add interactivity to Quarto with Shiny, Observable JS, htmlwidgets or Jupyter Widgets. Lastly, the workshop will cover Quarto Projects for aggregating many files such as complex web sites or entire books. Presented by <a href="https://themockup.blog/about.html">Tom Mock</a>, Customer Enablement Lead at RStudio, this workshop will be appropriate for attendees who answer yes to these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you programmed in R and want to better encapsulate your code, documentation, and outputs in a cohesive “data product”?</li>
<li>Do you want to learn about the next generation of RMarkdown for data science?</li>
<li>Do you want to have a better interactive experience when writing technical or scientific documents with literate programming?</li>
</ul>

<section id="talks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="talks">Talks</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sched.co/11iZa"><strong>Quarto for R Markdown users</strong></a>:
<ul>
<li>Presented by <a href="https://themockup.blog/about.html">Tom Mock</a>, Customer Enablement Lead at RStudio.</li>
<li>Wednesday July 27, 3:20pm - 3:40pm EDT.</li>
<li>Are you curious about Quarto? Maybe you saw it on Twitter or the RStudio::conf agenda. Perhaps this raised questions like: What exactly is Quarto? What about RMarkdown? (don’t worry it’s not going away!) What features does Quarto add? What should I do with my existing Rmd/ipynb files? This talk will answer all of those questions and more! I’ll present Quarto as a next-gen version of RMarkdown, compare the similarities, and then discuss the new features in Quarto for publishing documents, presentations, blog posts, lab notebooks and more! Lastly, I’ll cover what this means for our customers using RStudio Team, and the exciting new world for Python users.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://sched.co/11ibN"><strong>These are a few of my favorite things (about Quarto presentations)</strong></a>:
<ul>
<li>Presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/tracykteal">Tracy Teal</a>, Open Source Program Director at RStudio.</li>
<li>Thursday July 28, 2022 3:20pm - 3:40pm EDT.</li>
<li>Quarto is the next generation of RMarkdown, and comes with a new presentation format, revealjs. In this talk, I’ll show a few of my favorite things about making interactive HTML presentations with Quarto. Along the way you’ll learn about the visual editor, multiple columns, delivering an effective talk with speaker notes and mode, making your presentations pop with transitions, effective ways to incorporate code into your presentation, beautiful themes (and how to match your corporate style guide), and sharing it as pdf and HTML. I’ll finish off with a brief look at generating a PowerPoint presentation from a template.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://sched.co/11ibe"><strong>Literate Programming With Jupyter Notebooks and Quarto</strong></a>:
<ul>
<li>Presented by <a href="https://hamel.dev/">Hamel Husain</a>, head of Data Science at <a href="https://outerbounds.com/">Outerbounds</a> (the developers of <a href="https://metaflow.org/">Metaflow</a>) and core developer at <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a>.</li>
<li>Thursday July 28, 3:40pm - 4:00pm EDT.</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebooks play a critical role in in the workflow of many users. Notebooks are used to document existing code, to quickly prototype and iterate on ideas, and as a medium of technical communication. However, package developers typically use an entirely separate set of more traditional development tools, and the context switching between these tools and notebooks can be frustrating. Not only do you lose the ability to iterate fast, but you lose the ability to document and test your code in-situ, requiring you to create documentation and tests separately from source code. Nbdev is a literate programming framework that allows you to develop Python libraries within Jupyter Notebooks. This talk will describe the integration between Nbdev and Quarto, which enables library developers to author their documentation right alongside their code, and automatically produce a Quarto website for their package. The result is a seamless workflow for developing, documenting, and testing software packages all within Jupyter Notebooks, with no context-switching required.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://sched.co/11ibV"><strong>Websites &amp; Books &amp; Blogs, oh my! Creating Rich Content with Quarto</strong></a>:
<ul>
<li>Presented by <a href="https://github.com/dpastoor">Devin Pastoor</a>, Solutions Engineer at RStudio.</li>
<li>Thursday July 28, 4:00pm - 4:20pm EDT.</li>
<li>A number of packages have emerged in the R ecosystem to help create websites (hugodown), books (bookdown), and blogs (blogdown). In this talk, I’ll show you how Quarto handles creating these types of content and more. Whether you’re a grad student considering your first blog post about R, or a python expert about to write a technical book, I’ll show you how Quarto enables you to focus on content while it takes care of the rest. In addition, I’ll show the RStudio team is making it as easy as possible to publish and share content within your organization and to the whole community.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Quarto supports a variety of page layout options that enable you to author content that</p>
<ul>
<li>Fills the main content region</li>
<li>Overflows the content region</li>
<li>Spans the entire page</li>
<li>Occupies the document margin</li>
</ul>
<p>This post will demonstrate a few of the capabilities for positioning content in the margin of the page. You can read more about the complete capabilities in the the <a href="../../../../docs/authoring/article-layout.html">Article Layout Guide</a>.<br>

</div></div></section>
<section id="margin-references" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="margin-references">Margin References</h2>
<p>Footnotes and the bibliography typically appear at the end of the document, but you can choose to have them placed in the margin by setting the following option[^1] in the document front matter:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;">---</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">reference-location</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> margin</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">citation-location</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> margin</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;">---</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>With these options set, footnotes and citations will (respectively) be automatically be placed in the margin of the document rather than the bottom of the page. As an example, when I cite <span class="citation" data-cites="xie2018">Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund (2018)</span>, the citation bibliography entry itself will now appear in the margin.</p>

  <title>Customizing Table Output</title>
  <dc:creator>JJ Allaire</dc:creator>
  <link>https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2022-02-15-feature-tables/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Quarto includes a number of features aimed at making it easy to to author and customize markdown table output, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specifying column alignment and widths.</li>
<li>Providing captions, subcaptions, and cross-references.</li>
<li>Generating tables dynamically from executable code cells.</li>
</ul>
<p>This post provides an overview of these capabilities in Quarto. For more detail about all the features Quarto for authoring tables, see <a href="../../../../docs/authoring/tables.html">Tables</a>.</p>
<section id="markdown-tables" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="markdown-tables">Markdown Tables</h2>
<p>The most commonly used markdown table is known as a pipe table. Pipe tables support specifying per column alignment as well as captions. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb1-1">| Default | Left | Right | Center |</span>
<span id="cb1-2">|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|</span>
<span id="cb1-3">| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |</span>
<span id="cb1-4">| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |</span>
<span id="cb1-5">| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |</span>
<span id="cb1-6"></span>
<span id="cb1-7">: Demonstration of pipe table sytnax</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here is the table rendered to HTML:</p>
<table class="table">
<caption>Demonstration of pipe table syntax</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Default</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Left</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">Right</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Center</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>12</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">12</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">12</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">12</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>123</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">123</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">123</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">123</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">1</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">1</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<section id="caption-location" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="caption-location">Caption Location</h4>
<p>By default, table captions are positioned above tables. You can modify this behavior using the <code>tbl-cap-location</code> option. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;">---</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">tbl-cap-location</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> top</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;">---</span></span></code></pre></div>
</section>
</section>
<section id="explicit-column-widths" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="explicit-column-widths">Explicit Column Widths</h2>
<p>Beyond standard pipe table syntax for expressing column width, you can also explicitly specify columns widths using the <code>tbl-colwidths</code> attribute or document-level option. For an individual markdown table, add the attribute after the caption. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb3-1">| fruit  | price  |</span>
<span id="cb3-2">|--------|--------:</span>
<span id="cb3-3">| apple  | 2.05   |</span>
<span id="cb3-4">| pear   | 1.37   |</span>
<span id="cb3-5">| orange | 3.09   |</span>
<span id="cb3-6"></span>
<span id="cb3-7">: Fruit prices {tbl-colwidths="<span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;">[</span><span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">75,25</span><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;">]</span>"}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that this option is specified at the top level so that it can be shared by both PDF and HTML formats. If you are only targeting a single format you can place it alongside other <code>format</code> specific options.</p>
<p>Valid values for the caption location include:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>top</code></td>
<td>Position the caption above the table.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>bottom</code></td>
<td>Position the caption below the table.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>margin</code></td>
<td>Position the caption in the margin.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</section>
<section id="computations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computations">Computations</h2>
<p>All of the options described above work for tables produced by executable code cells. For example, here we apply the <code>tbl-cap</code>, <code>tbl-colwidths</code> and <code>tbl-caption-location</code> options to a code cell:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="in" style="color: #5E5E5E;">```{r}</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;">#| tbl-cap: "Cars"</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;">#| tbl-colwidths: [60,40]</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;">#| tbl-cap-location: margin</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">library</span>(knitr)</span>
<span id="cb4-7"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">kable</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">head</span>(cars))</span>
<span id="cb4-8"><span class="in" style="color: #5E5E5E;">```</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In addition to the above, which focused on some of the features of Quarto when writing pipe tables in markdown, you can also author tables using grid syntax. You review the <a href="../../../../docs/authoring/tables.html">documentation</a>. for more detail.</p>

  <dc:creator>Charles Teague</dc:creator>
  <link>https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2022-02-13-feature-callouts/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Callouts are an excellent way to draw extra attention to certain concepts, or to more clearly indicate that certain content is supplemental or applicable to only some scenarios.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2022-02-13-feature-callouts/callouts.png" class="preview-image img-fluid figure-img" alt="Three calout boxes: A note (has a blue banner with info icon preceding the header), a tip (has a green banner with lightbulb icon preceding the header), and an important (has a red banner with info exclamation-point icon preceding the header)."></p>
</figure>
</div>
<section id="callout-basics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="callout-basics">Callout Basics</h2>
<p>There are five different types of callouts available.</p>
<ul>
<li>note</li>
<li>tip</li>
<li>important</li>
<li>caution</li>
<li>warning</li>
</ul>
<p>The color and icon will be different depending upon the type that you select.</p>
</section>
<section id="syntax" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>Create callouts in markdown using the following syntax (note that the first markdown heading used within the callout is used as the callout heading):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb1-1">:::{.callout-note}</span>
<span id="cb1-2">Note that there are five types of callouts, including:</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span class="in" style="color: #5E5E5E;">`note`</span>, <span class="in" style="color: #5E5E5E;">`tip`</span>, <span class="in" style="color: #5E5E5E;">`warning`</span>, <span class="in" style="color: #5E5E5E;">`caution`</span>, and <span class="in" style="color: #5E5E5E;">`important`</span>.</span>
<span id="cb1-4">:::</span>
<span id="cb1-5"></span>
<span id="cb1-6">:::{.callout-tip}</span>
<span id="cb1-7"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">## Tip With Caption</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"></span>
