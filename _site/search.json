    "text": "Quarto is designed to be highly compatible with existing R Markdown documents. You should generally be able to use Quarto to render any existing Rmd document without changes.\nOne important difference between R Markdown documents and Quarto documents is that in Quarto chunk options are typically included in special comments at the top of code chunks rather than within the line that begins the chunk. For example:\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-cap: \"Air Quality\"\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + \n        geom_point() + \n        geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE)\n```\nQuarto uses this approach to both better accommodate longer options like fig-cap, fig-subcap, and fig-alt as well as to make it straightforward to edit chunk options within more structured editors that don’t have an easy way to edit chunk metadata (e.g. most traditional notebook UIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that if you prefer it is still possible to include chunk options on the first line (e.g. ```{r, echo = FALSE}). That said, we recommend using the comment-based syntax to make documents more portable and consistent across execution engines.\n\n\nChunk options included this way use YAML syntax rather than R syntax for consistency with options provided in YAML front matter. You can still however use R code for option values by prefacing them with !expr. For example:\n#| fig-cap: !expr paste(\"Air\", \"Quality\")"

See this article on managing project specific environments with Conda for additional details.\nTo create a new environment in the directory env:\nconda create --prefix env python\nIf this is the first time you’ve used conda in your shell, you may need to execute one of the following commands before using other conda tools:\n\n\n\n\n\nShell\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows (Command)\n\n\n\n\nconda init cmd.exe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows (PowerShell)\n\n\n\n\nconda init powershell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux / Older Mac (Bash)\n\n\n\n\nconda init bash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewer Mac (Zsh)\n\n\n\n\nconda init zsh\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will likely need to exit and restart your terminal for conda init to be reflected in your session.\nTo use the environment you need to activate it, which you do as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\nconda activate .\\env\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac/Linux\n\n\n\n\nconda activate ./env\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve activated the environment, you need to ensure that you have the packages required to render your documents. This will typically encompass jupyter / jupyterlab plus whatever other packages are used in your Python code. Use conda install to install packages into your environment. For example:\nconda install jupyterlab\nconda install pandas matplotlib \nAssuming you installed all of the required packages (likely more than just pandas and matplotlib) you should now be able to quarto render documents within the directory.\nUse conda deactivate to exit an activated environment:\nconda deactivate\n\nSaving Environments\nTo make your environment reproducible, you need to create a environment.yml file that enumerates all of the packages in use. Do this using the conda env export command:\nconda env export > environment.yml\nYou should generally check the environment.yml file into version control.\n\n\nRestoring Environments\nTo reproduce the environment on another machine you just pass the environment.yml file as an argument to conda create:\nconda create --prefix env -f environment.yml"

You can also install GitHub packages using the renv::install function. For example:\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")      # install from CRAN\nrenv::install(\"tidyverse/dplyr\") # install from GitHub\nTo install Python packages just use pip as described above from the built-in RStudio terminal.\n\nSaving Environments\nTo record the current versions of all R (and optionally Python) packages, use the renv::snapshot() function:\nrenv::snapshot()\nThis will record an renv.lock file for R packages and a requirements.txt file for Python packages).

    "text": "You can use the freeze option to denote that computational documents should never be re-rendered during a global project render, or alternatively only be re-rendered when their source file changes:\nexecute:\n  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render\nexecute:\n  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes\nNote that freeze controls whether execution occurs during global project renders. If you do an incremental render of either a single document or a project sub-directory then code is always executed. For example:\n# render single document (always executes code)\nquarto render document.qmd\n\n# render project subdirectory (always executes code)\nquarto render articles\n\nUsing Freeze\nFreeze is generally used when you have either a large number of collaborators or many computational documents created over a longer period of time. In both cases it can be challenging to fully re-execute every document when you render the site. This could be because some documents have esoteric or environment-specific requirements (e.g. require access/authentication to a data source) or due to general fragility of dependencies over time. Using freeze ensures that you can always reproducibly render your site.\nThe computational results of documents executed with freeze are stored in the _freeze directory, and re-used when needed to fulfill document renders. You should check the contents of _freeze into version control so that others rendering the project don’t need to reproduce your computational environment to render it in their environment.\nNote that you’ll still want to take care to fully re-render your project when things outside of source code change (e.g. input data). You can remove previously frozen output by deleting the _freeze folder at the root of yourproject.\n\n\nVirtual Environments\nYou can also combine freeze with the use of virtual environments to divide your project into sub-directories that each have their own set of dependencies. This allows multiple collaborators to use a set of localized dependencies for the documents they are responsible for, but at the same time still be able to render the entire project without requiring all of its dependencies.\nTo learn how to create and use a virtual environment, see the full documentation on Virtual Environments\nHere’s an example workflow of using virtual environments with freeze:\n\nInclude freeze: true in the project execution options:\nexecute:\n  freeze: true\nCreate a sub-directory of documents (e.g. research), and initialize and use a virtual environment within it:\nresearch/\n  document1.qmd\n  document2.qmd\n  env/\n  requirements.txt\nWhen working wihtin this sub-directory, activate the virtual environment before rendering its documents. For example:\ncd research\nsource venv/bin/activate\nquarto render               # render all files in subdir\nquarto render document.qmd  # render a single-file\n\nThis sub-directory render won’t use the cached freeze results but instead will re-run all of the computations using the directory-specific virtual environment. You can of course also include sub-directories within this directory and their documents will also be rendered using the parent virtual environment."

You can change the default sizes using the fig-width and fig-height options. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    fig-width: 8\n    fig-height: 6\n  pdf:\n    fig-width: 7\n    fig-height: 5\n---\nHow do these sizes make their way into the engine-level defaults for generating figures? This differs by engine:\n\nFor the Knitr engine, these values become the default values for the fig.width and fig.height chunk options. You can override these default values via chunk level options.\nFor the Jupyter engine, these values are used to set the Matplotlib figure.figsize rcParam (you can of course manually override these defaults for any given plot).\nIf you are using another graphics library with Jupyter and want to utilize these values, you can read them from QUARTO_FIG_WIDTH and QUARTO_FIG_HEIGHT environment variables.\n\n\nCaption and Alt Text\nYou can specify the caption and alt text for figures generated from code using the fig-cap and fig-alt options. For example, here we add these options to a Python code cell that creates a plot:\n```{python}\n#| fig-cap: \"Polar axis plot\"\n#| fig-alt: \"A line plot on a polar axis\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```"

Use options to force the use of caching on all chunks, disable the use of caching on all chunks (even if it’s specified in options), or to force a refresh of the cache even if it has not been invalidated:\nquarto render example.qmd --cache \nquarto render example.qmd --no-cache \nquarto render example.qmd --cache-refresh \nNote that for Jupyter, the cache for a document is invalidated if any of the code blocks change. For Knitr, invalidation occurs on a per-cell basis.\n\n\nDisabling Execution\nIn some cases, you may want to prevent execution entirely. This is especially useful if you author using a standard notebook editor (e.g. JupyterLab) and plan on executing chunks only within the notebook UI. Specify execute: false to skip execution when rendering (you’ll naturally still get the output that was generated within the notebook editor):\nexecute: false\nIf you are temporarily disabling execution and don’t want to overwrite other execute options, you can alternatively just add enabled: false to the execute options:\nexecute:\n  enabled: false\n  echo: true\n  warning: false\nYou might want to have different execution policies for Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) and text-based computational markdown (.qmd). You can do this using the ipynb option:\nexecute:\n  ipynb: false\nYou might use this option if you are implementing of policy of having all notebook execution occur within Jupyter / JupyterLab, while having Quarto still handle converting the notebook to HTML, PDF, etc.\n\n\nJupyter Kernel\nThe Jupyter kernel is determined using the jupyter metdata option. For example, to use the Xeus Python kernel, do this:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\njupyter: xpython\n---\nNote that you can also provide a full kerenlspec, for example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\njupyter: \n  kernelspec:\n    name: \"xpython\"\n    language: \"python\"\n    display_name: \"Python 3.7 (XPython)\"\n---\nIf no Jupyter kernel is specified, then the kernel is determined by finding an available kernel that supports the language of the first executable code block found within the file (e.g. ```{python}).\n\n\nJupyter Daemon\nTo mitigate the ~ 2 second start-up time for the Jupyter Python kernel (and potentially much longer start-up times for other kernels), Quarto keeps a daemon with a running Jupyter kernel alive for each document. This enables subsequent renders to proceed immediately without having to wait for kernel start-up.\nThe purpose of the daemon is to make render more responsive during interactive sessions. Accordingly, no daemon is created when documents are rendered without an active tty or when they are part of a batch rendering (e.g. in a Quarto Project).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that Quarto does not use a daemon by default on Windows (as some Windows systems will not allow the socket connection required by the daemon).\n\n\nYou can customize this behavior using the daemon execution option. Set it to false to prevent the use of a daemon, or set it to a value (in seconds) to determine the period after which the daemon will timeout (the default is 300 seconds). For example:\nexecute:\n  daemon: false\nexecute:\n  daemon: 60\nNote that if you want to use a daemon on Windows you need to enable it explicitly:\nexecute:\n  daemon: true\n\nCommand Line\nYou can also control use of the Jupyter daemon using the following command line options:\n# use a daemon w/ default timeout (300 sec)\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon\n\n# use a daemon w/ an explicit timeout\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon 60\n\n# prevent use of a daemon\nquarto render document.qmd --no-execute-daemon\nYou can also force an existing daemon to restart using the --execute-daemon-restart command line flag:\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon-restart \nThis might be useful if you suspect that the re-use of notebook sessions is causing an error.\nFinally, you can print extended debugging information about daemon usage (startup, shutdown, connections, etc.) using the --execute-debug flag:\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-debug"

For example, here we demonstrate the use of the output and code-overflow options:\n```{python}\n#| echo: fenced\n#| output: false\n#| code-overflow: wrap\n1 + 1\n```\nThis code block appears in the rendered document as:\n\n```{python}\n#| output: false\n#| code-overflow: wrap\n1 + 1\n```\n\nNote that all YAML options will be included in the fenced code output except for echo: fenced (as that might be confusing to readers).\nThis behavior can also be specified at the document level if you want all of your executable code blocks to include the fenced delimiter and YAML options:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nformat: html\nexecute:\n  echo: fenced\n---\n\nUnexecuted Blocks\nOften you’ll want to include a fenced code block purely as documentation (not executable). You can do this by using two curly braces around the language (e.g. python, r, etc.) rather than one. For example:\n```{{python}}\n1 + 1\n```\nWill be output into the document as:\n```{python}\n1 + 1\n```\nIf you want to show an example with multiple code blocks and other markdown, just enclose the entire example in 4 backticks (e.g. ````) and use the two curly brace syntax for code blocks within. For example:\n````\n---\ntitle: \"My document\"\n---\n\nSome markdown content.\n\n```{{python}}\n1 + 1\n```\n\nSome additional markdown content.\n\n````"

This enables you to use the following syntax to refer to it elsewhere in the document:\nSee @fig-elephant for an illustration.\nHere is what this would look like rendered to HTML:\n\nQuarto enables you to create cross-references to figures, tables, equations, sections, code listings, theorems, proofs, and more.

There are however several differences (mostly related to handling computational output) to note:\n\nQuarto uses the prefix #fig- rather than #fig: (which is more compatible with Jupyter notebook cell ids).\nQuarto is able to reference raw HTML and LaTeX figures and tables (which are often produced by executable code blocks).\nQuarto has support for referencing theorems and proofs (and related types)."

To do this, enclose the figures in a div (with its own label and caption) and give each subfigure its own label and caption. You can then refer to either the entire figure in a reference or a single subfigure:\n::: {#fig-elephants layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Surus](surus.png){#fig-surus}\n\n![Hanno](hanno.png){#fig-hanno}\n\nFamous Elephants\n:::\n\nSee @fig-elephants for examples.

See the article on Figures and Layout for more details on laying out panels of figures.\n\n\nComputations\nFigures produced by Jupyter and Knitr can also be cross-referenced. To do this, add a label and fig-cap option at the top of the code block. For example:\n\nJupyterKnitr\n\n\n```{python}\n#| label: fig-plot\n#| fig-cap: \"Plot\"\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1,23,2,4])\nplt.show()\n```\n\nFor example, see @fig-plot.\n\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-plot\n#| fig-cap: \"Plot\"\n\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nFor example, see @fig-plot.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also create multiple figures within a Jupyter code cell and reference them as subfigures. To do this use fig-cap for the main caption, and fig-subcap to provide an array of subcaptions. For example:\n```{python}\n#| label: fig-plots\n#| fig-cap: \"Plots\" \n#| fig-subcap:\n#|   - \"Plot 1\"\n#|   - \"Plot 2\" \n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1,23,2,4])\nplt.show()\n\nplt.plot([8,65,23,90])\nplt.show()\n```\n\nSee @fig-plots for examples.

For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\ncrossref:\n  fig-title: Fig     # (default is \"Figure\")\n  tbl-title: Tbl     # (default is \"Table\")\n  title-delim: —     # (default is \":\")\n---\n\n\nReferences\nYou can specify the prefix used for inline reference type using *-prefix options. You can also specify whether references should be hyper-linked using the ref-hyperlink option. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\ncrossref:\n  fig-prefix: figure   # (default is \"fig.\")\n  tbl-prefix: table    # (default is \"tbl.\")\n  ref-hyperlink: false # (default is true)\n---\n\n\nNumbering\nThere are a variety of numbering schemes available for cross-references, including:\n\narabic (1, 2, 3)\nroman (I, II, III, IV)\nroman i (i, ii, iii, iv)\nalpha x (start from letter ‘x’)\nalpha X (start from letter ‘X’)\n\nYou can specify the number scheme used for all types (other than sub-references) using the labels option. For sub-references (e.g. subfigures), you can specify the number scheme using the subref-labels option. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\ncrossref:\n  labels: alpha a        # (default is arabic)\n  subref-labels: roman i # (default is alpha a)\n---\nIf you would like, you can specify the number scheme for a specific type using the *-labels options.

    "text": "Quarto will use Pandoc to automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a number of styles. To use this capability, you will need:\n\nA quarto document formatted with citations (see Citation Markdown).\nA bibliographic data source, for example a BibTeX (.bib) file.\nOptionally, a CSL file which specifies the formatting to use when generating the citations and bibliography.\n\n\nBibliography Files\nQuarto supports bibliography files in a wide variety of formats including BibTeX and CSL. Add a bibliography to your document using the bibliography YAML metadata field. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can provide more than one bibliography file if you would like by setting the bibliography field’s value to a YAML array.\n\n\nSee the Pandoc Citations documentation for additional information on bibliography formats.\n\n\nCitation Syntax\nQuarto uses the standard Pandoc markdown representation for citations (e.g. [@citation]) — citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed of ‘@’ + the citation identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a locator, and a suffix. The citation key must begin with a letter, digit, or _, and may contain alphanumerics, _, and internal punctuation characters (:.#$%&-+?<>~/). Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Format\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nBlah Blah [see @knuth1984, pp. 33-35;\nalso @wickham2015, chap. 1]\nBlah Blah [see Knuth (1984), pp. 33-35; also Wickham (2015), chap. 1]\n\n\nBlah Blah [@knuth1984, pp. 33-35,\n38-39 and passim]\nBlah Blah [Knuth (1984), pp. 33-35, 38-39 and passim]\n\n\nBlah Blah [@wickham2015; @knuth1984].\nBlah Blah (Wickham 2015; Knuth 1984).\n\n\nWickham says blah [-@wickham2015]\nWickham says blah (2015)\n\n\n\nYou can also write in-text citations, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Format\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n@knuth1984 says blah.\nKnuth (1984) says blah.\n\n\n@knuth1984 [p. 33] says blah.\nKnuth (1984, 33) says blah.\n\n\n\nSee the Pandoc Citations documentation for additional information on citation syntax.\n\n\nCitation Style\nQuarto uses Pandoc to format citations and bibliographies. By default, Pandoc will use the Chicago Manual of Style author-date format, but you can specify a custom formatting using CSL (Citation Style Language). To provide a custom citation stylesheet, provide a path to a CSL file using the csl metadata field in your document, for example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: nature.csl\n---\nYou can find CSL files or learn more about using styles at the CSL Project. You can browse the list of more than 8,500 Creative Commons CSL definitions in the CSL Project’s central repository or Zotero’s style repository.\n\n\nBibliography Generation\nPandoc will automatically generate a list of works cited and place it in the document if the style calls for it. It will be placed in a div with the id refs if one exists:\n### References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\nIf no such div is found, the works cited list will be placed at the end of the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can suppress generation of a bibliography by including suppress-bibliography: true option in your document metadata\n\n\nHere’s an example of a generated bibliography:\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” The Computer Journal 27 (2): 97–111.\n\n\nWickham, Hadley. 2015. R Packages. 1st ed. O’Reilly Media, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nIncluding Uncited Items\nIf you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can define a dummy nocite metadata field and put the citations there:\n---\nnocite: |\n  @item1, @item2\n---\n\n@item3\nIn this example, the document will contain a citation for item3 only, but the bibliography will contain entries for item1, item2, and item3.\nIt is possible to create a bibliography with all the citations, whether or not they appear in the document, by using a wildcard:\n---\nnocite: |\n  @*\n---"

Quarto shortcodes are similar in form and function to Hugo shortcodes and WordPress shortcodes.\nQuarto currently supports just two shortcodes: meta and var. Additional shortcodes (e.g. for inserting videos, tweets, gists, etc.) will be developed soon.\n\nmeta\nThe meta shortcode allows you to insert content from Pandoc metadata (e.g. YAML at the top of the document and/or in _quarto.yml).\nFor example, the following shortcode inserts the value of the title field from YAML metadata:\n{{< meta title >}}\nYou can dereference sub-keys using the dot (.) delimiter. For example:\n{{< meta author.affiliation >}}\n\n\nvar\nThe var shortcode enables you to insert content from a project-level _variables.yml file. Create this file alongside your _quarto.yml project file, and then include references to those variables within any document in your project.\nVariables can be either simple values or can include arbitrary markdown content. To define variables, create a _variables.yml file in the root directory of your project. For example:\nversion: 1.2\n\nemail:\n  info: info@example.com\n  support: support@example.com\n\nengine:\n  jupyter: \"[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)\"\n  knitr: \"[Knitr](<https://yihui.name/knitr>)\"\nNote that the engine variable values include markdown for hyperlinks.\nTo include the value of a variable, use the {{< var >}} shortcode, for example:\nVersion {{< var version >}} is a minor upgrade.\n\nPlease contact us at {{< var email.info >}}.\n\nQuarto includes {{< var engine.jupyter >}} and \n{{< var engine.knitr >}} computation engines.\n\n\nEscaping\nIf you are writing documentation about using shortcodes (for example, this article!) you might need to prevent them from being processed. You can do this in two ways:\n\nEscape the shortcode reference like this:\n{{</* var version */>}}\nAdd a shortcodes=false attribute to any code block you want to prevent processing of shortcodes within:\n```{shortcodes=false}\n{{< var version >}}\n```"

    "text": "If the base features of Pandoc and Quarto don’t do exactly what you need, you can very likely create a Pandoc Filter that bridges the gap.\nPandoc consists of a set of readers and writers. When converting a document from one format to another, text is parsed by a reader into pandoc’s intermediate representation of the document—an “abstract syntax tree” or AST—which is then converted by the writer into the target format. The pandoc AST format is defined in the module Text.Pandoc.Definition in the pandoc-types package.\nA “filter” is a program that modifies the AST, between the reader and the writer.\nINPUT --reader--> AST --filter--> AST --writer--> OUTPUT\nPandoc’s built-in citation processing is implemented as a filter, as are many of Quarto’s extensions (e.g. cross-references, figure layout, etc.). Some other examples include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ninclude-files\nFilter to include other files in the document.\n\n\ninclude-code-files\nFilter to include code from source files.\n\n\npagebreak\nConverts paragraps containing only the LaTeX \\newpage or \\pagebreak command into appropriate pagebreak markup for other formats.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Filters\nAdd one or more filters to document rendering using the filters option. For example:\nfilters:\n   - include-files.lua\n   - pagebreak.lua\nBy default, user filters are run before Quarto’s built-in filters. If you prefer to control the order of filters visa-vi Quarto just include quarto explicitly as a filter. For example, to run include-files.lua before Quarto filters and pagebreak.lua after, use this:\nfilters:\n  - include-files.lua\n  - quarto\n  - pagebreak.lua\n\n\nWriting Filters\nYou can write Pandoc filters using Lua (via Pandoc’s built-in Lua interpreter) or using any other language using a JSON representation of the Pandoc AST piped to/from an external process.\nWe strongly recommend using Lua Filters, which have the following advantages:\n\nNo external dependencies\nHigh performance (no serialization or process execution overhead)\nAccess to Pandoc’s library of Lua helper functions.\n\nSee the documentation on Writing Lua Filters for additional details.\nIf you want to write a JSON filter, see the documentation on Writing JSON filters."

For example:\n![Elephant](elephant.png)\nThis results in the following treatment for various output types:\n\n\n\nHTML\nPDF\nWord\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that for LaTeX / PDF output figures are automatically numbered (you can arrange for figures to be numbered in other formats using Cross References).\n\nLinked Figures\nWhen rendering with Quarto, you can enclose a figure within a link and it will still be treated within output as a captioned figure. For example:\n[![Elephant](elephant.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)\n\n\nFigure Alignment\nFigures and their captions are center aligned by default. Add the fig-align attribute to the image to use a different alignment. For example:\n![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n\nAlt Text\nYou can add alternative text to a figure by adding the fig-alt attribute to the image. For example, the following Markdown…\n![](elephant.png){fig-alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\"}\n… will create the following HTML with the corresponding alt tag:\n<img src=\"elephant.png\" alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\">\nNote that the figure caption, title, and alt text can all be different. For example, the following code…\n![Elephant](elephant.png \"Title: An elephant\"){fig-alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\"}\n…produces this HTML:\n<img src=\"elephant.png\" title=\"Title: An elephant\" alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\">\n\n\nLaTeX Environments\nThere are a number of LaTeX packages that provide custom figure environments. For example, the mdframed package includes an mdframed environment used to enclose figures in a special border style. By default, Quarto uses the standard figure environment, but you can use the fig-env attribute to specify a custom one. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"Sidenotes\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    header-includes: |\n      \\usepackage{sidenotes}\n---\n\n![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-env=\"marginfigure\"}"

In this case \"layout=\"[[1,1], [1]]\" translates to: create two rows, the first of which has two columns of equal size and the second of which has a single column.\nNote that the numbers in a row are arbitrary and don’t need to add up to a particular total. You can therefore use whatever scheme is most natural. For example, here we define columns that occupy varying percentage widths of the row:\n::: {layout=\"[[70,30], [100]]\"}\n![Surus](surus.png)\n\n![Hanno](hanno.png)\n\n![Lin Wang](lin-wang.png)\n:::\nYou can also use negative values to create space between elements.

A simple example:\n::: {layout=\"[25,-2,10]\" layout-valign=\"bottom\"}\n![Surus](surus.png)\n\n![Lin Wang](lin-wang.png)\n:::\n\nNote that vertical alignment isn’t limited to images, you can also vertically align any other elements that are included in a panel."

Here are examples for both Jupyter and Knitr:\n\nJupyterKnitr\n\n\n```{python}\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1,23,2,4])\nplt.show()\n\nplt.plot([8,65,23,90])\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n\n```{r}\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\nplot(cars)\nplot(pressure)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables\nYou can also use layout attributes for tables produced by Knitr or Jupyter. For example, this Rmd code chunk creates side-by-side tables:\n```{r}\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\nlibrary(knitr)\nkable(head(cars), caption = \"Cars\")\nkable(head(pressure), caption = \"Pressure\")\n```\n\n\n\nCustom Layout\nThe layout works the same way for figures or tables produced by knitr or Jupyter. For example, here’s an Rmd code chunk that produces 3 plots and defines a custom layout for them:\n```{r}\n#| layout: [[45,-10, 45], [100]]\n\nplot(cars)\nplot(pressure)\nplot(mtcars)\n```"

    "section": "CSS Styles",
    "text": "One of the benefits of authoring with markdown is that your content can be easily published to a wide variety of formats. This is possible in significant measure because of the limitations that markdown imposes: you author in terms of the structure and semantics of your content, rather than worrying about specifically how things will appear.\nSometimes however you know that you’ll be publishing to HTML, and you want to exert more control over how things look. In this case, you can use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) along with markdown to do custom formatting. This section covers how to:\n\nDefine CSS styles for your document; and\nApply those styles to entities within your document.\n\nIf you are new to CSS, you may want to brush up on the basics before proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS styles apply only to HTML output, and will not have any impact on the formatting of other output types like PDF or MS Word.\n\n\n\n\nDefining Styles\nThe best way to include CSS styles is to create an external stylesheet (e.g. styles.css), then include it within the output options of your document. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"CSS Demo\"\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    css: styles.css\n---\nThe styles.css file might look something like this:\n.important {\n  color: maroon;\n}\n\n.illustration {\n  border: 1px solid rgb(230, 230, 230); \n}\nNote that it’s also possible to define styles inline with a CSS code chunk, but we recommend using an external file for easier manageability.\nWithin a markdown document you can apply one or more CSS classes to various document entities including headings, images, divs, and spans. CSS classes are applied using pandoc attributes. Once you’ve applied a class to an entity, it will derive its formatting from the CSS properties of the specified class.\n\n\nHeadings\nTo add a CSS class to a heading, use the edit button at the top right of the heading that appears when your cursor is within it (or use the F4 keyboard shortcut):\n\nNote the presence of the .important class within the Edit Attributes dialog.\nCSS classes applied to headings affect all content beneath the heading (an HTML <section> tag is wrapped around the content by Pandoc), so heading classes are a great way to provide custom styles for entire sections of your document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the visual editor doesn’t currently render content using styles applied through CSS classes so you won’t see the custom formatting while editing. You will however see it when rendering and previewing the HTML version of the document.\n\n\n\n\n\nImages\nYou can apply CSS classes to images (for example, to give them a special border) using the standard Image dialog. To do this, double-click the image (or use the F4 shortcut with the image selected) and apply the desired classes:\n\nNote again that the visual editor won’t display your image with the applied CSS classes while editing, however when actually rendering the document to HTML you’ll see the styles reflected.\n\n\nDivs\nDivs are special entities that allow you to apply identifiers and/or styles to a region of a document. Divs are block elements (like paragraphs).\nYou can create divs using the Insert -> Div command, and you can apply attributes (including CSS classes) to divs the same way as you apply attributes to headings (clicking the edit button or using the F4 keyboard shortcut when you are within a div):\n\nNote the presence of the .important class within the Div Attributes dialog.\n\n\nSpans\nSpan are special entities that allow you to apply identifiers and/or styles to a region of text. Spans are inline formatting marks (like bold or italic).\nSpans can be created by selecting text and using the Format -> Span command:\n\nHere we’ve applied a span to the text “customize PDF reports” and we’ve used the span to apply the .important CSS class. Note that as with headings and images the formatting is not displayed in the visual editor, but will be visible when the document is rendered."

    "text": "The Quarto visual editor generates markdown using Pandoc. This means that in some cases your markdown will be rewritten to conform to standard Pandoc idioms. For example, Pandoc inserts 3 spaces after list bullets and automatically escapes characters that might be used for markdown syntax.\nHere is a list of conventions for Pandoc generated markdown that might differ from your own markdown writing style:\n\n*text* is used in preference to _text_\nBacktick code blocks are written as ``` {.md} rather than ```md\nBacktick code blocks with no attributes are rendered as 4-space indented code blocks\nHorizontal rules are written as dashes spanning the full width of the document\nPlain links are written as <https://yihui.org> rather than https://yihui.org\nBullet and numbered lists use additional leading spaces before list item content\nThe blockquote character (>) is included on each new line of a blockquote\nTable captions are written below rather than above tables\nMultiline HTML and TeX blocks use the explicit raw attribute (e.g. ```{=tex})\nInline footnotes are replaced with footnotes immediately below the paragraph\nNested divs use ::: at all levels so long as their attributes are distinct\nUnnumbered sections are designated with {.unnumbered} rather than {-}\nCharacters used for markdown syntax (e.g. *, _, or #) are always escaped\n\nWhile some of this behavior might be bothersome at first, if you decide that visual editing mode is useful for your workflow it’s probably best to just adapt to writing your own markdown the same way that Pandoc does. Note that you can also configure source mode to write markdown using these conventions, ensuring that the same markdown is written no matter which mode edits originate from."

    "title": "Markdown Output",
    "section": "Writer Options",
    "text": "Some aspects of markdown output can be customized via global, project, or file-level options, including:\n\nHow to wrap / break lines (fixed column, sentence-per-line, etc.).\nWhere to write footnotes (below the current paragraph or section, or at the end of the document).\nWhether to use the visual mode markdown writer when saving markdown from source mode (to ensure consistency between documents saved from either mode).\n\nYou can set these options within the R Markdown Global Options or Project Options, or can alternatively set them on a per-file basis using YAML (as described below).\n\nLine Wrapping\nBy default, the visual editor writes Markdown with no line wrapping (paragraphs all occupy a single line). This matches the behavior of markdown source editing mode within RStudio.\nHowever, if you prefer to insert line breaks at a particular column (e.g. 72 or 80), or to insert a line break after each sentence, you can set a global or per-project editor option to this effect.\nYou can also set this behavior on a per-document basis via the wrap option. For example, to wrap lines after 72 characters you would use this:\n---\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: 72\n---\nTo insert a line break after each sentence, use wrap: sentence. For example:\n---\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: sentence\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithm used for sentence wrapping will handle English and Japanese text well, but may not detect the end of sentences accurately for other languages.\n\n\n\nIf you have enabled a global line wrapping option and want to turn off wrapping for a given document, use wrap: none.\n\n\nReferences\nBy default, references are written at the end of the block where their corresponding footnote appears. You can override this behavior using the references option.\nFor example, to write references at the end of sections rather than blocks you would use:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    references: \n      location: block\n---\nValid values for the references option are block, section, and document.\nNote that you can also set a global or per-project editor option to control reference writing behavior.\nIf you are aggregating a set of markdown documents into a larger work, you may want to make sure that reference identifiers are unique across all of your documents (e.g. you don’t want to have [^1] appear multiple times). You can ensure uniqueness via the prefix option. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    references: \n      location: block\n      prefix: \"mydoc\"\n---\nThis will result in footnotes in this document using the specified prefix (e.g. [^mydoc-1]), ensuring they are globally unique across the manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you are within a Quarto book project then a references prefix is applied automatically so no changes to editor_options are required.\n\n\n\n\n\nCanonical Mode\nIf you have a workflow that involves editing in both visual and source mode, you may want to ensure that the same markdown is written no matter which mode edits originate from. You can accomplish this using the canonical option. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: 72\n    references: \n      location: block\n    canonical: true\n---\nWith canonical: true, edits in visual mode and source mode will result in identical markdown output. This is especially useful if you have multiple authors collaborating using version control, with a mixture of source and visual mode editing among the authors."

Citations can be inserted from a variety of sources:\n\nYour document bibliography.\nZotero personal or group libraries.\nDOI (Document Object Identifier) references.\nSearches of Crossref, DataCite, or PubMed.\n\nIf you insert citations from Zotero, DOI look-up, or a search then they are automatically added to your document bibliography.\n\nBibliographies\nPandoc supports bibliographies in a wide variety of formats including BibTeX and CSL. Add a bibliography to your document using the bibliography YAML metadata field. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\nlink-citations: true\n---\nNote that we’ve also specified the link-citations option, which will make your citations hyperlinks to the corresponding bibliography entries.\nSee the Pandoc Citations documentation for additional information on bibliography formats.\n\n\nInserting Citations\nYou insert citations by either using the Insert -> Citation command or by using markdown syntax directly (e.g. [@cite] or @cite) .\nCitations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed of ‘@’ + the citation identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a locator, and a suffix. The citation key must begin with a letter, digit, or _, and may contain alphanumerics, _, and internal punctuation characters (:.#$%&-+?<>~/). Here are some examples:\n\n  \n    Blah Blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, chap. 1].\n  \n\n\n  Blah Blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and passim].\n  \n\n\n  Blah Blah [@smith04;\n  @doe99].\n\n  Smith says blah [-@smith04].\n  \n\nYou can also write in-text citations, as follows:\n\n  \n    @smith04 says blah.\n  \n  \n    @smith04 [p. 33] says blah.\n  \n\nSee the Pandoc Citations documentation for additional information on citation syntax.\nUse the  toolbar button or the ⇧⌘ F8 keyboard shortcut to show the Insert Citation dialog:\n\nNote that you can insert multiple citations by using the add button on the right side of the item display.\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nYou can also insert citations directly using markdown syntax (e.g. [@cite]). When you do this a completion interface is provided for searching available citations:\n\n\n\nCitation IDs\nBefore inserting a citation from an external source you will may wish to customize its ID. Within the Insert Citation dialog, click the edit button on the right side of citations to change their ID:\n\nIf you insert a new citation via code completion, you will also be provided with the opportunity to change its default citation ID.\nFor citations inserted from Zotero, you can also use the Better BibTeX plugin to generate citation IDs (this can be enabled via Citation Options if you have Better BibTeX installed).\n\n\nCitation Preview\nOnce you’ve inserted a citation, place the cursor over it to see a preview of it along with a link to the source if one is available:\n\n\n\n\nCitations from DOIs\nUse the From DOI pane of the Insert Citation dialog to insert a citation based on a DOI (e.g that you have retrieved from a PubMed or other search):\n\nIf you are using markdown syntax, you can also paste a DOI after the [@ and it will be looked up:\n\nOnce you’ve confirmed that it’s the correct work (and possibly modified the suggested ID), the citation will be inserted into the document and an entry for the work added to your bibliography.\n\n\nCitations from Search\nUse the Crossref, DataCite, and PubMed panes of the Insert Citation dialog to search one of those services for a citation:\n\nItems inserted from a search will automatically be added to your bibliography.\nNote that for PubMed queries you can use the full supported query syntax. For example, this query searches on the author and title fields: Peterson[Author] AND Embolism[Title]. You can learn more about building PubMed queries here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/advanced/.\n\n\nCitations from Zotero\nZotero is a popular free and open source reference manager. If you use Zotero, you can also insert citations directly from your Zotero libraries. If you have Zotero installed locally its location will be detected automatically and citations from your main library (My Library) will be available:\n\nZotero references will also show up automatically in completions:\n\nItems from Zotero will appear alongside items from your bibliography with a small “Z” logo juxtaposed over them. If you insert a citation from Zotero that isn’t already in your bibliography then it will be automatically added to the bibliography.\nIf you are running both RStudio and Zotero on your desktop, then no additional configuration is required for connecting to your Zotero library. If however you using RStudio Server and/or want to access your Zotero library over the web, then a few more steps are required (see the Zotero Web API section for details).\n\nGroup Libraries\nZotero Groups provide a powerful way to share collections with a class or work closely with colleagues on a project. By default, Zotero Group Libraries are not included in the Insert Citation dialog or citation completions. However, there are options available to use group libraries at a global, per-project, or per-document level.\nFor example, here we specify a project-level option to use the Reproducible Research Series (Year 1) group library:\n\nYou can also specify one or more libraries within YAML. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"Reproducible Research\"\nzotero: \"Reproducible Research Series (Year 1)\"\n---\nNote that you can also turn off Zotero entirely for a document using zotero: false:\n---\ntitle: \"Reproducible Research\"\nzotero: false\n---\n\n\nZotero Web API\nIf you are using RStudio Server and/or don’t have Zotero installed locally, you can still access your Zotero library using the Zotero Web API (assuming you have a Zotero web account and have synced your libraries to your account).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are running RStudio Desktop, it’s generally easier to also run Zotero on your desktop and access your library locally. That said, it is possible to access Zotero web libraries from RStudio Desktop if you prefer that configuration.\n\n\n\n\nAPI Access Key\nRStudio accesses Zotero web libraries using the Zotero Web API, so the first step is to create a Zotero account and then configure Zotero to sync its data to your account. You can do this using the Sync tab of the Zotero preferences:\n\nOnce you’ve configured your library to sync, you need to create a Zotero API Key to use with RStudio:\n\nFollow the instructions to create a new access key. Note that if you want to use Group Libraries with RStudio that you should change the default to provide read-only access to groups (as illustrated above).\nBe sure to record your key after generating it (i.e. copy it to the clipboard and/or save it somewhere more permanent) as you won’t be able to view it again after you navigate away.\nFinally, go to the R Markdown -> Citations preferences to connect Zotero to RStudio using your key:\n\nSet the Zotero Library option to “Web”, then paste in your Zotero Web API Key. You can use Verify Key… button to confirm that your Zotero API key is working correctly.\nOnce you’ve confirmed your connection you are ready to start inserting citations from Zotero."

    "section": "Render & Server Contexts",
    "text": "To break this down more clearly, let’s revisit the “Hello, Shiny” document we started with in the introduction to interactive documents:\n---\ntitle: \"Old Faithful\"\nformat: html\nserver: shiny\n---\n\n```{r}\nsliderInput(\"bins\", \"Number of bins:\", \n            min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)\nplotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| context: server\noutput$distPlot <- renderPlot({\n  x <- faithful[, 2]  # Old Faithful Geyser data\n  bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)\n  hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')\n})\n```\nHere is how execution breaks down for this document:\n\nThe first code chunk that contains the calls to sliderInput() and plotOutput() will execute when you render the document (e.g. quarto render old-faithful.qmd).\nThe second code chunk with the context: server option will not execute at render time, but rather will execute only when the document is served.\n\nIt’s critical to understand that the two chunks are run in completely separate R sessions. That means that you cannot access variables created in the first chunk within the second, and vice-versa. The is analogous to the ui.R and server.R scripts that compose most normal Shiny applications.\nOf course, it’s quite useful to be able to re-use code between contexts, and we’ll cover some ways to do this in the Sharing Code section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make the code of interactive documents straightforward to understand and work with, we strongly recommend that your server contexts (there can be more than one) be located at the bottom of the document. This makes the separate execution environments more clear in the flow of the document source code.\n\n\n\n\nserver.R\nThere is one other option if you prefer to have a stronger separation. You can restrict your .qmd file to only code that will execute at render time, and then split out the server code into a separate server.R file.\nRe-writing our example in this fashion would look like this:\n\nold-faithful.qmd\n---\ntitle: \"Old Faithful\"\nformat: html\nserver: shiny\n---\n\n```{r}\nsliderInput(\"bins\", \"Number of bins:\", \n            min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)\nplotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n```\n\n\nserver.R\nfunction(input, output, session) {\n  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({\n    x <- faithful[, 2]  # Old Faithful Geyser data\n    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)\n    hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')\n  })\n}\nThis is perhaps a bit less convenient but does align better with the traditional ui.R / server.R separation that exists in traditional Shiny applications."

    "title": "Execution Contexts",
    "section": "Sharing Code",
    "text": "Sharing code between rendering contexts works a bit differently depending on if your code is in a single .qmd file or if it uses server.R. We’ll cover both scenarios below.\n\nSingle File\n\ncontext: setup\nTo have code execute in both rendering and serving contexts, create a code chunk with context: setup. For example:\n```{r}\n#| context: setup\n#| include: false\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# load data\ndataset <- import_data(\"data.csv\")\ndataset <- sample_n(dataset, 1000)\n```\nThis code will execute at both render time as well as when the server is created for each new user session. Note that we also specify include: false to make sure that code, warnings, and output from the chunk are not included in the rendered document.\n\n\ncontext: data\nThe loading and manipulation of data often dominates the startup time of Shiny applications. Since interactive documents are executed in two phases (the initial render and then the serving of the document to users) we can perform the expensive data manipulations during rendering and then simply load the data when starting up the application.\nYou can define prerendered data by adding the context: data option to an R code chunk. The chunk will be executed during render and any R objects it creates will be saved to an .RData file, which will then be loaded during Shiny server startup. For example, we could take the the setup chunk illustrated above and factor out the data loading into its own chunk:\n```{r}\n#| context: data\n#| include: false\n\ndataset <- import_data(\"data.csv\")\ndataset <- sample_n(dataset, 1000)\n```\nNote that R objects created within a context: data chunk are available to both the UI rendering and server contexts.\n\n\nKnitr cache\nYou can further improve the performance of data rendering by adding the cache: true option to the data chunk. This will cause the code chunk to be re-executed only when required. For example:\n```{r}\n#| context: data\n#| include: false\n#| cache: true\n#| cache.extra: !expr file.info(\"data.csv\")$mtime\n\ndataset <- import_data(\"data.csv\")\ndataset <- sample_n(dataset, 1000)\n```\nIn this example the cache will be invalidated if either the R code in the chunk changes or the modification time of the “data.csv” file changes (this is accomplished using the cache.extra option).\nYou can also invalidate an existing cache by removing the _cache directory alongside with your interactive document.\n\n\ncontext: server-start\nThere is one additional execution context that enables you to share code and data across multiple user sessions. Chunks with context: server-start executee once when the Shiny document is first run and are not re-executed for each new user of the document. Using context: server-start is appropriate for several scenarios including:\n\nEstablishing shared connections to remote servers (e.g. databases, Spark contexts, etc.).\nCreating reactive values intended to be shared across sessions (e.g. with reactivePoll or reactiveFileReader).\n\nFor example:\n```{r}\n#| context: server-start\n\nlibrary(DBI)\ndb <- dbConnect(...)\n```\n\n\n\nMultiple Files\nIf your interactive document uses a .qmd file to define the user-interface and a server.R file for the server, you can put shared code in a file named global.R. Functions and variables defined within global.R will be available both during render as well as during execution of the server.\nIn this scenario your interactive document consists of 3 source files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndoc.qmd\nMarkdown content as well as Shiny inputs and outputs (e.g. sliderInput(), plotOutput(), etc.)\n\n\nserver.R\nMain server function with reactive expressions, assignments to outputs, etc.\n\n\nglobal.R\nCode shared between doc.qmd and server.R."

    "text": "By default, OJS cells show their full source code and output within rendered documents. Depending on the type of document you are creating you might want to change this behavior either globally or for individual cells.\n\nCode Visibility\nThe echo option controls whether cells display their source code. To prevent display of code for an entire document, set the echo: false option in YAML metadata:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n---\nYou can also specify this option on a per-cell basis. For example:\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: false\ndata = FileAttachment(\"palmer-penguins.csv\").csv({ typed: true })\n```\n\n\nOutput Visibility\nOJS cell output is also displayed by default. You can change this at a global or (more likely) per-cell level using the output option. For example, here we disable output for a cell:\n```{ojs}\n//| output: false\ndata\n```\nNote that cells which only carry assignments do not print their output by default. For example, this assignment won’t print anything:\nIf you want to print even the results of assignments, you can specify the output: all option. For example:\nIf you click the inspector you’ll see it expand to reveal a subset of the data as JSON.\n\n\nCode Display\nWe talked about showing and hiding source code above, but what about controlling exactly how it’s displayed?\nThere are options available for customizing the appearance of code blocks (highlighting, background, border, etc.) as well as how horizontal overflow is handled. See the article on HTML Code Blocks for all of the details.\nOne option we wanted to specifically highlight here is code folding, which enables you to collapse code but still provide an option for users to view it. This is especially handy for custom JavaScript visualizations as they often span dozens of lines of code.\nAdd the code-fold: true option to a code cell to enable code folding (you can also enable this globally). For example, click the “Code” button to show the code block (note the code-fold: true option is specified)\n\n\nCode\n```{ojs}\n//| code-fold: true\npdata = FileAttachment(\"palmer-penguins.csv\").csv({typed: true})\n\nPlot.plot({\n  facet: {\n    data: pdata,\n    x: \"sex\",\n    y: \"species\",\n    marginRight: 80\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.frame(),\n    Plot.rectY(pdata, \n      Plot.binX(\n        {y: \"count\"}, \n        {x: \"body_mass\", thresholds: 20, fill: \"species\"}\n      )\n    ),\n    Plot.tickX(pdata, \n      Plot.groupZ(\n        {x: \"median\"}, \n        {x: \"body_mass\",\n         z: d => d.sex + d.species,\n         stroke: \"#333\",\n         strokeWidth: 2\n        }\n      )\n    )\n  ]\n})\n```"

You can perform this preprocessing during document render (in an {r} or {python} code cell) and then make it available to {ojs} cells via the ojs_define() function.\nHere’s an example. We’ll read the same data into R, do some grouping and summarization, then make it available to OJS using ojs_define:\n\n```{r}\n#| output: false\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nco2 = read_csv(\"co2_mm.csv\")  %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarize(max = max(average))\n\nojs_define(co2data = co2)\n```\n\nNote that we could have done the same thing using Python (the ojs_define function is available in any document that uses R or Python).\nNow we plot the data using Observable Plot:\n\n```{ojs}\nyearlyChart = Plot.plot({\n  marks: [\n    Plot.line(transpose(co2data), \n      {x: \"year\", y: \"max\"}, \n      { stroke: \"black\" }\n    )\n  ]}\n)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the NOAA C02 example for the full source code.\n\nTranspose\nYou’ll note one additional twist in the OJS code above: we call the transpose function on our co2data before plotting it. The transpose function is built in to Quarto’s OJS engine, and will convert column-oriented datasets (like the ones used in Python and R) into the row-oriented datasets used by many JavaScript plotting libraries (including Plot).\nFor example, the following JSON data emitted from R or Python:\n{\n  \"year\": [1958, 1959, 1960],\n  \"max\":  [317.51, 318.29, 320.04]\n}\nIs converted to the following via the call to transpose:\n[\n  { \"year\": 1959, \"max\": 317.51 },\n  { \"year\": 1960, \"max\": 318.29 },\n  { \"year\": 1960, \"max\": 320.04 }\n]\nCheck the documentation for whatever plotting library you are using from OJS to see whether a call to transpose is required."

In this scenario, data pre-processing is done once during render time then all subsequent interactions are handled on the client.\nBut what if you want to do data transformation dynamically in response to user inputs? This is also possible with ojs_define(), as it can be passed not just static values but also Shiny reactives (assuming it’s running inside a Shiny interactive document)."

On the client we have familiar looking OJS inputs and a plot laid out using panel: sidebar and panel: fill:\n```{ojs}\n//| panel: sidebar\nvars = [\"Sepal.Length\", \"Sepal.Width\", \"Petal.Length\", \"Petal.Width\"]\nviewof xcol = Inputs.select(vars, {label: \"X Variable\"})\nviewof ycol = Inputs.select(vars, {label: \"Y Variable\", value: vars[1]})\nviewof count = Inputs.range([1, 9], {label: \"Cluster Count\", step: 1, value: 3})\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| panel: fill\nPlot.plot({\n  color: {\n    type: \"ordinal\",\n    scheme: \"category10\"\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.dot(transpose(selectedData), {\n      x: xcol,\n      y: ycol,\n      fill: (d, i) => clusters.cluster[i],\n    }),\n    Plot.dot(clusters.centers, { \n      x: d => d[0],\n      y: d => d[1],\n      r: 10,\n      stroke: \"black\",\n      fill: (d, i) => i + 1\n    }),\n  ]\n})\n```\nNote that the plotting code references the variables selectedData and clusters. These will be provided by reactive expressions within the Shiny server code. Note also that we use the transpose() function to reshape the data into the row-oriented format that the Plot library expects.\nHere is the server code:\n```{r}\n#| context: server\n\nselectedData <- reactive({\n  iris[, c(input$xcol, input$ycol)]\n})\n\nclusters <- reactive({\n  kmeans(selectedData(), input$count)\n})\n\nojs_define(selectedData, clusters)\n```\nWe designate this code as running on the server via the context: server option.\nNote that we reference several inputs that were defined by viewof expressions on the client (e.g. input$xcol). When these inputs change they will cause the appropriate server side reactives to re-execute.\nWe create two reactive values (selectedData and clusters) and provide them to the client using ojs_define(). The plot will be automatically re-drawn on the client side when these values change."

    "text": "OJS to Shiny\nIn the example above we took advantage of the fact that by default OJS viewof expressions are automatically propagated to Shiny inputs (e.g input$xcol). This provides a reasonable separation of concerns, and prevents excess network traffic in the case that you have large OJS variables.\nHowever, if you want to use other OJS variables as Shiny inputs this is also possible using the ojs-export option. The default behavior maps to the following configuration:\n---\nserver:\n  type: shiny\n  ojs-export: viewof\n---\nYou can also specify ojs-export: all to cause all OJS reactives to be bound to Shiny inputs:\n---\nserver:\n  type: shiny\n  ojs-export: all\n---\nAlternatively, you can specify a list of OJS reactives by name (including using ~ to filter out reactives), and optionally combine this with the viewof and/or all options. For example:\n---\nserver:\n  type: shiny\n  ojs-export: [all, ~large_dataset]\n---\n\n\nShiny to OJS\nLess common but occasionally useful is the ability to bind Shiny inputs into OJS. By default no such bindings occur, however you can use the ojs-import option to opt-in for specific Shiny inputs. For example:\n---\nserver: \n  type: shiny\n  ojs-import: [minimum, maximum]\n---"

Additionally, you can use Observable JS (“OJS”) in standalone documents and websites via its core libraries. Quarto uses these libraries along with a compiler that is run at render time to enable the use of OJS within Quarto documents.\nOJS works in any Quarto document (plain markdown as well as Jupyter and Knitr documents).

    "text": "We’ll start with a simple example based on Allison Horst’s Palmer Penguins dataset. Here we look at how penguin body mass varies across both sex and species (use the provided inputs to filter the dataset by bill length and island):\n\nfiltered = transpose(data).filter(function(penguin) {\n  return bill_length_min < penguin.bill_length &&\n         islands.includes(penguin.island);\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof bill_length_min = Inputs.range(\n  [32, 50], \n  {value: 35, step: 1, label: \"Bill length (min):\"}\n)\nviewof islands = Inputs.checkbox(\n  [\"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\", \"Dream\"], \n  { value: [\"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\"], \n    label: \"Islands:\"\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot.rectY(filtered, \n  Plot.binX(\n    {y: \"count\"}, \n    {x: \"body_mass\", fill: \"species\", thresholds: 20}\n  ))\n  .plot({\n    facet: {\n      data: filtered,\n      x: \"sex\",\n      y: \"species\",\n      marginRight: 80\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.frame(),\n    ]\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the source code for this example. First we create an {ojs} cell that reads in some data from a CSV file using a FileAttachment:\n```{ojs}\ndata = FileAttachment(\"palmer-penguins.csv\").csv({ typed: true })\n```\nThe example above doesn’t plot all of the data but rather a filtered subset. To create our filter we’ll need some inputs, and we’ll want to be able to use the values of these inputs in our filtering function. To do this, we use the viewof keyword and with some standard Inputs:\n```{ojs}\nviewof bill_length_min = Inputs.range(\n  [32, 50], \n  {value: 35, step: 1, label: \"Bill length (min):\"}\n)\nviewof islands = Inputs.checkbox(\n  [\"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\", \"Dream\"], \n  { value: [\"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\"], \n    label: \"Islands:\"\n  }\n)\n```\nNow we write the filtering function that will transform the data read from the CSV using the values of bill_length_min and island.\n```{ojs}\nfiltered = data.filter(function(penguin) {\n  return bill_length_min < penguin.bill_length &&\n         islands.includes(penguin.island);\n})\n```\nHere we see reactivity in action: we don’t need any special syntax to refer to the dynamic input values, they “just work”, and the filtering code is automatically re-run when the inputs change. This works in much the same way a spreadsheet works when you update a cell and other cells that refer to it are recalculated.\nFinally, we’ll plot the filtered data using Observable Plot (an open-source JavaScript library for quick visualization of tabular data):\n```{ojs}\nPlot.rectY(filtered, \n  Plot.binX(\n    {y: \"count\"}, \n    {x: \"body_mass\", fill: \"species\", thresholds: 20}\n  ))\n  .plot({\n    facet: {\n      data: filtered,\n      x: \"sex\",\n      y: \"species\",\n      marginRight: 80\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.frame(),\n    ]\n  }\n)\n```\nNote that as with our inputs, we refer to the filtered variable with no special syntax—the plotting code will be automatically re-run whenever filtered changes (which in turn is updated whenever an input changes).\nThat covers a basic end-to-end use of OJS (see the Penguins examples for the full source code).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you take a look at the Penguins code, you’ll notice something curious: the inputs and plotting code are defined before the data processing code. This demonstrates a critical difference between OJS cell execution and traditional notebooks: cells do not need to be defined in any particular order.\nBecause execution is fully reactive, the runtime will automatically execute cells in the correct order based on how they reference each other. This is more akin to a spreadsheet than a traditional notebook with linear cell execution."

For example, here we import a some libraries using the require function (which in turn loads NPM modules from jsDelivr):\n```{ojs}\nd3 = require(\"d3@7\")\ntopojson = require(\"topojson\")\n```\nSee the article on Libraries to learn more about using standard and third-party libraries."

File attachments support many formats including CSV, TSV, JSON, SQLite, and Arrow so are a convenient way to read a dataset that has already been prepared for analysis.\nFrequently though you’ll need to do some pre-processing of your data in Python or R before it’s ready for visualization. Within Quarto, you can do this pre-processing during document render then make the results available to OJS.\nUse the ojs_define() function from Python or R to define variables that you want to use within JavaScript. For example, to reproduce the simple CSV read in Python you might do this:\n\n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\npenguins = pd.read_csv(\"examples/palmer-penguins.csv\")\nojs_define(data = penguins)\n```\n\n\n\n\nThe call to ojs_define(data = penguins) says that we want to make a variable named data (with the value of the penguins data frame) available to OJS\nDepending on the visualization library you use, one additional step may be required to consume the data from JavaScript. In this case, the Plot function expects data by row rather than by column, so we transpose() it before filtering:\n```{ojs}\nfiltered = transpose(data).filter(function(penguin) {\n  return bill_length_min < penguin.bill_length &&\n         islands.includes(penguin.island);\n})\n```\nSee the article on Data Sources to learn more about the various ways to prepare and read data."

The former (.panel-fill) will fill all available space, the latter (.panel-center) will leave some horizontal margin around its content.\nFor example, here is the source code of the user-interface portion of the Shiny application displayed above:\n---\ntitle: \"Iris K-Means Clustering\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    page-layout: custom\nserver: shiny\n---\n\n```{r}\n#| panel: sidebar\nvars <- setdiff(names(iris), \"Species\")\nselectInput('xcol', 'X Variable', vars)\nselectInput('ycol', 'Y Variable', vars, selected = vars[[2]])\nnumericInput('clusters', 'Cluster count', 3, min = 1, max = 9)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| panel: fill\nplotOutput('plot1')\n```\nThe panel: fill option is added to the plot output chunk. You can alternately use panel: center if you want to leave some horizontal margin around the contents of the panel.\nAdding the panel option to a code chunk is shorthand for adding the CSS class to its containing div (i.e. it’s equivalent to surrounding the code chunk with a div with class e.g. panel-fill).\nHere’s an example of using a sidebar with OJS inputs:\n\nTo do this you would use the following code:\n```{ojs}\n//| panel: sidebar\n\nviewof myage = {\n  const myage = select({\n    title: \"Quelle classe d'âge voulez-vous cartographier ?\",\n    options: ages,\n    value: \"80etplus\"\n  });\n  return myage;\n}\n\nviewof pctvax = slider({\n  title: '<br/>Objectif de vaccination',\n  description: '200% signifie 2 doses par personnes pour tout le monde',\n  min: 50,\n  max: 200,\n  value: 200,\n  step: 10,\n  format: v => v + \"%\"\n})\n\nviewof overlay = radio({\n  title: \"Écarter les cercles\",\n  options: [{ label: 'Oui', value: 'Y' }, { label: 'Non', value: 'N' }],\n  value: 'N'\n})\n\nviewof label = radio({\n  title: \"Numéros des départements\",\n  options: [{ label: 'Afficher', value: 'Y' }, { label: 'Masquer', value: 'N' }],\n  value: 'N'\n})\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| panel: fill\n\n(vaccine visualization code)\n\n```"

This code block has no background.\"}\n\nYou can combine a background and border treatment as well as customize the left border color:\n\n``` yaml\ncode-background: true\ncode-border-left: \"#31BAE9\"\n```\n\n![](images/code-custom.png){fig-alt=\"A block of code with a gray background and a blue vertical stripe running along its left border.\"}\n\n## Highlighting\n\nYou can specify the code highlighting style using `highlight-style` and specifying one of the supported themes. Supported themes include all the themes included in Pandoc:\n\n-   pygments\n-   tango\n-   espresso\n-   zenburn\n-   kate\n-   monochrome\n-   breezedark\n-   haddock\n\nAs well as an additional set of extended themes including:\n\n-   arrow\n-   atom-one\n-   ayu\n-   breeze\n-   dracula\n-   github\n-   gruvbox\n-   mokokai\n-   nord\n-   oblivion\n-   printing\n-   radical\n-   solarized\n-   vim-dark\n\nFor example:\n\n``` yaml\nhighlight-style: github\n```\n\nHighlighting themes can provide either a single highlighting definition or two definitions, one optimized for a light colored background and another optimized for a dark color background. When available, Quarto will automatically select the appropriate style based upon the code chunk background color's darkness. Users may always opt to specify the full name (e.g. `atom-one-dark`) to by pass this automatic behavior.\n\nBy default, code is highlighted using the `arrow` theme, which optimized for accessibility. We've additionally introduced the `arrow-dark` theme which is designed to provide accessible highlighting against dark backgrounds.\n\nExamples of the light and dark themes:\n\n#### Arrow (light)\n\n![](images/arrow.png){fig.alt=\"A block of code showcasing the Arrow (light) theme.\"}\n\n#### Arrow (dark)\n\n![](images/arrow-dark.png){fig.alt=\"A block of code showcasing the Arrow (dark) theme.\"}\n\n#### Ayu (light)\n\n![](images/ayu.png){fig.alt=\"A block of code showcasing the Ayu (light) theme.\"}\n\n#### Ayu (dark)\n\n![](images/ayu-dark.png){.preview-image fig.alt=\"A block of code showcasing the Ayu (dark) theme.\"}\n\n## Copy Button\n\nHover over the code block below and you will see a copy icon in the top-right corner:\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nlibrary(dygraphs)\ndygraph(nhtemp, main = \"New Haven Temperatures\") %>% \n  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c(\"1920-01-01\", \"1960-01-01\"))\n```\n\nThis behavior is enabled by default but you configure it using the `code-copy` option:\n\n``` yaml\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-copy: false\n```\n\nValid values for `code-copy` include:\n\n|         |                                |\n|---------|--------------------------------|\n| `hover` | Show button on hover (default) |\n| `true`  | Always show code copy button   |\n| `false` | Never show code copy button    |\n\n## Code Linking\n\nThe `code-link` option enables hyper-linking of functions within code blocks to their online documentation:\n\n``` yaml\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-link: true\n```\n\nCode linking is currently implemented only for the knitr engine (via the [downlit](https://downlit.r-lib.org) package)."

Unlike RPubs, RStudio Connect is a server that you run inside an organization, so is suitable for publishing content that you only want visible within your organization’s network.\nYou can publish Quarto documents using the quarto_publish_doc() function from the R quarto package. For example, here we publish a document to both RPubs and an RStudio Connect server:\nlibrary(quarto)\nquarto_publish_doc(\"mydoc.qmd\", server = \"rpubs.com\")\nquarto_publish_doc(\"mydoc.qmd\", server = \"rsc.example.com\")\nNote that once you’ve published a document to a particular server you can omit the server argument when updating the document:\nquarto_publish_doc(\"mydoc.qmd\")\nYou can also publish to RPubs and RStudio Connect directly from within RStudio. To do this, just click the Publish button  on the editor toolbar or preview window:\n\nYou should be running the daily build of RStudio if you want to publish Quarto documents.

The following basic connection information is required:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nindex-name\nThe name of the index to use when performing a search.\n\n\napplication-id\nThe unique ID used by Algolia to identify your application.\n\n\nsearch-only-api-key\nThe Search-Only API key to use to connect to Algolia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBe sure to use the Search Only API key, which provides read only access to your index and is safe to include in project files. Never use your Admin API key in a Quarto document or project.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\nwebsite:\n  search:\n    algolia:\n      index-name: <my-index-name>\n      application-id: <my-application-id>\n      search-only-api-key: <my-search-only-api-key>\n\n\nCustom Index Schema\nIf you are simply using the search.json file generated by Quarto as your Algolia index, the above configuration information is all that is required to set up search using Algolia.\nHowever, if you are generating an index in some other fashion, you may need to provide additional information to specify which fields Quarto should use when searching. You do this by including an index-fields key under aloglia which specifies the names of specific fields in your index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nhref\nThe field to use to read the URL to this index entry. The user will be navigated to this URL when they select the matching search result. Note that Quarto groups results by URL (not including the anchor when grouping).\nThis field is required (either as an existing field in your index or with a mapped field name).\n\n\ntitle\nThe field to use to read the title of the index entry.\nThis field is required (either as an existing field in your index or with a mapped field name).\n\n\ntext\nThe field to use to read the text of the index entry.\nThis field is required (either as an existing field in your index or with a mapped field name).\n\n\nsection\nThe field to use to read the section of the index entry. Quarto groups results by URL and uses the section information (if present) to show matching subsections of the same document.\nThis field is optional.\n\n\n\nAny or all of the above may be specified in your Quarto project file. For example:\nwebsite:\n  search:\n    algolia:\n      index-name: <my-index-name>\n      application-id: <my-application-id>\n      search-only-api-key: <my-search-only-api-key>\n    index-fields:\n      href: url\n      section: sec\n      text: body\n    \n\n\nAlgolia Insights\nBy default, Algolia provides a number of insights based upon the performance of your Algolia search. In addition, it may be helpful to understand more detailed tracking of the results that are viewed and clicked. You can enable click and conversion tracking using Algolia by setting the analytics-events to true:\nwebsite:\n  search:\n    algolia:\n      index-name: <my-index-name>\n      application-id: <my-application-id>\n      search-only-api-key: <my-search-only-api-key>\n      analytics-events: true\nYou can confirm that events are being properly sent to Algolia using the Event Debugger. Note that the click and conversion events use cookies to maintain an anonymous user identifier—if cookie consent is enabled, search events will only be enabled if cookie consent has been granted.\n\n\nAdvanced Configuration\nIn addition to the above configuration, you may also pass Algolia specific parameters when executing a search. For example, you may want to limit results to a particular facet or set of tags. To specify parameters, add the params key to your algolia yaml and provide params. For information about about available parameters, see Algolia’s Search API Parameters.\nFor example:\nwebsite:\n  search:\n    algolia:\n      index-name: <my-index-name>\n      application-id: <my-application-id>\n      search-only-api-key: <my-search-only-api-key>\n    index-fields:\n      href: url\n      section: sec\n      text: body\n    params:\n      tagFilters: ['tag1','tag2']"

Here’s what the “docked” and “floating” styles look like (respectively):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are all of the options available for side navigation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nid\nOptional identifier (used only for hybrid navigation, described below).\n\n\ntitle\nSidebar title (uses the project title if none is specified).\n\n\nsubtitle\nOptional subtitle\n\n\nlogo\nOptional logo image\n\n\nsearch\nInclude a search box (true or false).

Defaults to “light”.\n\n\nforeground\nForeground color (“primary”, “secondary”, “success”, “danger”, “warning”, “info”, “light”, “dark”, or hex color). The foreground color will be used to color navigation elements, text and links that appear in the sidebar.\n\n\nalignment\nAlignment (“left”, “right”, or “center”).\n\n\ncollapse-level\nWhether to show sidebar navigation collapsed by default. The default is 2, which shows the top and next level fully expanded (but leaves the 3rd and subsequent levels collapsed).\n\n\npinned\nAlways show a title bar that expands to show the sidebar at narrower screen widths (true or false).

Browser default 404 pages can be pretty stark, so you may want to create a custom page with a more friendly message and perhaps pointers on how users might find what they are looking for.\nMost web serving platforms (e.g. Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.) will use a file named 404.html in the root of your website as a custom error page if you provide it. You can include a custom 404 page in a Quarto website by creating a markdown file named 404.md in the root of your project. For example:\n---\ntitle: Page Not Found\n---\n\nThe page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).\n\nYou may want to try searching to find the page's new location.\nNote that you can use HTML alongside markdown within your 404.md file in order to get exactly the appearance and layout you want.\nYour 404 page will appear within the chrome of your site (e.g. fonts, css, layout, navigation, etc.). This is so that users don’t feel that they’ve irrecoverably “left” your site when they get a 404 error. If you don’t want this behavior, then provide a 404.html rather than 404.md.\nHere are some examples of how various popular websites handle custom 404 pages: https://blog.fluidui.com/top-404-error-page-examples/.\n\nNon-Root Site Paths\nIf your website is served from the root of a domain (e.g. https://example.com/) then simply providing a 404.md file as described above is all that’s required to create a custom 404 page.\nHowever, if your website is not served from the root of a domain then you need to provide one additional bit of configuration to make sure that resources (e.g. your site’s CSS) are resolved correctly within 404 pages.\nFor example, if your site is served from https://example.com/mysite/ then you’d add the following to your project website configuration within _quarto.yml:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"My Site\"\n  site-path: \"/mysite/\"\nNote that if you are already providing a site-url (which is required for generation of sitemaps and social metadata preview images) then it’s enough to simply include the path within the site-url:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"My Site\"\n  site-url: \"https://example.com/mysite/\""

When a link to your site is included in a Tweet, Twitter automatically crawls your site and fetches any Twitter Card metadata. To enable the automatic generation of Twitter Card metadata for your site, you can add the following to your _quarto.yml configuration file:\nwebsite:\n  twitter-card: true\nIn this case, Quarto will automatically generate a title, description, and preview image for the content. For more information about how Quarto finds preview images, see Preview Images.\nYou may also provide additional metadata to be used when generating the Twitter Card, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntitle\nThe title of the page. Quarto will automatically use the title metadata from the page metadata. If you’d like you can override this just for the Twitter Card by including a title in the twitter-card metadata.\n\n\ndescription\nA short description of the content.

This is useful when you need to specify a mix of global options (for example, site) with per document options such as title or image.\n\n\nOpen Graph\nThe Open Graph protocol is a specification that enables richer sharing of links to articles on the web. It will improve the previews of your content when a link to it is pasted into applications like Slack, Discord, Facebook, Linkedin, and more. To enable the automatic generation of Open Graph metadata for your content, include the following in your _quarto.yml configuration file:\nwebsite:\n  opengraph: true\nIn this case, Quarto will automatically generate a title, description, and preview image for the content.

This is useful when you need to specify a mix of global options (for example, site) with per document options such as title or image.\n\n\nPreview Images\nYou can specify a preview image for your article in several different ways:\n\nYou can explicitly provide a full url to the preview image using the image field in the appropriate metadata. For example:\ntitle: \"My Document\"\ntwitter-card:\n  image: \"https://quarto.org/images/preview-code.png\"\nYou may provide a document relative path to an image (such as images/preview-code.png) or a project relative path to an image (such as /images/preview-code.png). If you provide a relative path such as this, you must also provide a site-url in your site’s metadata. For example in your _quarto.yml configuration file:\nwebsite:\n  site-url: \"https://www.quarto.org\"\nand in your document front matter:\ntitle: \"My Document\"\ntwitter-card:\n  image: \"/images/preview-code.png\"\nAny image that is being rendered in the page may also be used as a preview image by giving it the class name preview-image. Quarto will select the first image it finds with this class. For example, the following image will be used as the preview image when included on a page:\n![](images/preview-code.png){.preview-image}\nIf you label an image with this class, you must also provide a site-url in your site’s metadata.\nIf none of the above ways of specifying a preview image have been used, Quarto will attempt to find a preview image by looking for an image included in the rendered document with one of the following names: preview.png, feature.png, cover.png, or thumbail.png."

We hope to do this in several dimensions:\n\nCreate a writing and publishing environment with great integreated tools for technical content. We want to make authoring with embedded code, equations, figures, complex diagrams, interactive widgets, citations, cross references, and the myriad other special requirements of scientific discourse straightforward and productive for everyone.\nHelp authors take full advantage of the web as a connected, interactive platform for communications, while still providing the ability to create excellent printed output from the same document source. Researchers shouldn’t need to choose between LaTeX, MS Word, and HTML but rather be able to author documents that target all of them at the same time.\nMake reproducible research and publications the norm rather than the exception. Reproducibility requires that the code and data required to create a manuscript are an integrated part of it. However, this isn’t often straightforward in practice—Quarto aims to make it easier to adopt a reproducible workflow than not.\n\nQuarto is open source software licensed under the GNU GPL v2. We believe that it’s better for everyone if the tools used for research and science are free and open. Reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and the leveling of the playing field by eliminating cost barriers are but a few of the shared benefits of free software in science."
