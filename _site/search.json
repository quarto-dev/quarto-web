See the documentation on Output Outputs for additional details.\n\n\nCell Execution\nNote that when rendering an .ipynb Quarto will not execute the cells within the notebook by default (the presumption being that you already executed them while editing the notebook). If you want to execute the cells you can pass the --execute flag to render:\nquarto render notebook.ipynb --execute\nYou can also specify this behavior within the notebook’s YAML front matter:\n---\ntitle: \"My Notebook\"\nexecute: \n  enabled: true\n---\nThere are many other execution options available (e.g. to control caching, optimizing kernel start-up time, etc.).

You should generally be able to use Quarto to render any existing Rmd document without changes.\nOne important difference between R Markdown documents and Quarto documents is that in Quarto chunk options are typically included in special comments at the top of code chunks rather than within the line that begins the chunk.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Quarto sounds similar to R Markdown. What is the difference and why create a new project?\nAt its core, Quarto works the same way as R Markdown: \n\nThe goal of Quarto is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better. Quarto combines the functionality of R Markdown, bookdown, distill, xaringian, etc into a single consistent system with “batteries included” that reflects everything we’ve learned from R Markdown over the past 10 years.\nThe number of languages and runtimes used for scientific discourse is very broad (and the Jupyter ecosystem in particular is extraordinarily popular). Quarto is at its core multi-language and multi-engine (supporting Knitr, Jupyter, and Observable today and potentially other engines tomorrow).\nOn the other hand, R Markdown is fundamentally tied to R which severely limits the number of practitioners it can benefit. Quarto is RStudio’s attempt to bring R Markdown to everyone! Unlike R Markdown, Quarto doesn’t have a dependency or requirement for R. Quarto was developed to be multilingual, beginning with R, Python, Javascript, and Julia, with the idea that it will work even for languages that don’t yet exist.\nWhile it is a “new” system, it should also be noted that it is highly compatible with existing content: you can render most R Markdown documents and Jupyter notebooks unmodified with Quarto. The concept is to make a major, long term investment in reproducible research, while keeping it compatible with existing formats and adaptable to the various environments users work in.\n\n\nIs R Markdown going away? Will my R Markdown documents continue to work?\nR Markdown is not going away! R Markdown is used extensively and continues to work well. It will continue to be actively supported. We’re not leaving R Markdown, we’re expanding our scope. Over the years there have been many feature requests, and rather than implementing them all in R Markdown, for certain features we may refer you to Quarto. Everything that is currently in R Markdown will continue to work and be supported. There are no plans for deprecation.\nRead more about this in Yihui Xie’s blog post With Quarto Coming, is R Markdown Going Away? No.\n\n\nShould I switch from R Markdown to Quarto?\nIf you like using R Markdown, there’s no need to switch! R Markdown will continue to be supported and work as it always has been. You’re welcome to try Quarto if you like, but there’s no need to switch. Some new features may only exist in Quarto, so if you want to use those, then that’s where you would give those a try.  \nWe should emphasize that switching is not imperative. While we don’t plan on major feature initiatives in R Markdown and related packages, we are going to continue to maintain them (smaller improvements and bug fixes) for a long time to come. Furthermore, since Rmd files can in most cases be rendered without modification by Quarto, you can continue using R Markdown and the switching cost will still be minimal whenever you decide to do it. \n\n\nI use X (bookdown, blogdown, etc.). What is the Quarto equivalent?\nHere are the Quarto equivalents for various packages and features of the R Markdown ecosystem (in some cases Quarto equivalents are not yet available but will be later this year):\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nR Markdown\nQuarto\n\n\n\n\nBasic Formats\n\nhtml_document\npdf_document\nword_document\n\n\nhtml\npdf\ndocx\n\n\n\nBeamer\n\nbeamer_presentation\n\n\nbeamer\n\n\n\nPowerPoint\n\npowerpoint_presentation\n\n\npptx\n\n\n\nHTML Slides\n\nxaringan\nioslides\nrevealjs\n\n\nrevealjs\n\n\n\nAdvanced Layout\n\ntufte\ndistill\n\n\nQuarto Article Layout\n\n\n\nCross References\n\nhtml_document2\npdf_document2\nword_document2\n\n\nQuarto Crossrefs\n\n\n\nWebsites & Blogs\n\nblogdown\ndistill\n\n\nQuarto Websites\nQuarto Blogs\n\n\n\nBooks\n\nbookdown\n\n\nQuarto Books\n\n\n\nInteractivity\nShiny Documents\nQuarto Interactive Documents\n\n\nPaged HTML\npagedown\nSummer 2022\n\n\nJournal Articles\nrticles\nSummer 2022\n\n\nDashboards\nflexdashboard\nFall 2022\n\n\nInteractive Tutorials\nlearnr\nNo equivalent planned\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you create custom formats for Quarto like you can for R Markdown?\nNot currently, but we expect that this capability will be available in version 1.0 of Quarto (which will be available before rstudio::conf in July).\n\n\nWhen would be a good time to start new projects in Quarto rather than R Markdown?\nOur current plan is to announce Quarto v1.0 at rstudio::conf (end of July). This will be a stable release that will be an excellent foundation for starting new projects with Quarto or migrating existing R Markdown projects (if you are so inclined).\n\n\nDoes the RStudio IDE support Quarto?\nYes! You need to use the latest release of RStudio (v2022.02), which includes support for editing and preview of Quarto documents.\nYou can download RStudio v2022.02 from https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.\n\n\nDoes RStudio Connect support Quarto?\nYes! You can publish Quarto content to RStudio Connect v2021.08.0 or later. Quarto has to be enabled as documented in the RStudio Connect admin guide. Connect’s user documentation refers to Quarto.org docs on how to publish from the RStudio IDE. To publish Python-based Quarto content, you can use the rsconnect-python CLI from various locations, including VSCode, JupyterLab or the terminal."

    "text": "What can I use Quarto for?\nQuarto® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. You can weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts, books and more. \n\n\n\nHow do I install Quarto?\nVisit the Quarto.org Get Started page, which provides installation instructions for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. \n\n\n\nIs Quarto free to use?\nYes! Quarto is open source with a GPL-2 license. You can use or disseminate it any way that you would any GPL-2 licensed open source software. \n\n\nWhat output formats can Quarto create?\nThere are many output formats available in Quarto. This includes all of the built in Pandoc formats (e.g. HTML, PDF, MS Word, Revealjs, ePub, etc.) as well as various ways to publish multiple documents (websites, blogs, and books). Learn more at Quarto Formats. \n\n\nWhat editing tools can I use with Quarto?\nYou can use a wide variety of tools with Quarto. We have provided documentation for writing and editing Quarto documents in VSCode, JupyterLab, RStudio IDE, or any text editor. Visit the Get Started with Quarto page to install, and then choose your tool for a brief introductory guide.\n\n\nCan I use Jupyter notebooks with Quarto?\nYes! Quarto can render Jupyter notebooks and you can use Jupyter, JupyterLab or any other .ipynb notebook editor with Quarto. You can render existing .ipynb notebooks as-is with Quarto, but adding Quarto-specific output options or a YAML header can enhance the output. Visit theJupyterLab page for more information.\n\n\nWhat programming languages are supported in Quarto?\nThe principal languages supported by Quarto are Python, R, Julia, and Observable JavaScript. Integration with Jupyter also enables the use of many other languages. \nEach Quarto document can be optionally processed by a computational engine (the engine can be manually specified or automatically detected based on the code chunks within). Current engines include Knitr (which is also used by R Markdown and supports a variety of languages including R, Python, and Julia, etc.) and Jupyter (which supports many languages including Python, Julia, and R). See the documentation on Engine Binding for additional details.\n\n\nWhat human languages are supported in Quarto?\nYou can write your Quarto documentation in your human language of choice. The lang document option is used to identify the main language of the document using IETF language tags (following the BCP 47 standard), such as en or en-GB. \n\n\nHow can I share documents and have people comment on them?\nYou can publish Quarto content to various locations. See the user guides for publishing documents and publishing websites  for details on using GitHub Pages, Netlify, RStudio Connect, and other services. with Quarto. Once documents are published you can use  hypothes.is, Utterances, or Giscus for commenting. Learn more in the documentation on commenting.\n\n\nCan I do collaborative editing with Quarto?\nThere is not yet anything specific for collaborative editing in Quarto. You can collaborate on .qmd files in the same way you currently do for any text or code files. \nRStudio Workbench allows for Project Sharing for interactive editing and collaboration on the same document.\n\n\nWhere can I publish Quarto websites?\nThere are a wide variety of ways to publish Quarto websites. Website content is by default written to the _site sub-directory (you can customize this using the output-dir option). Publishing is simply a matter of copying the output directory to a web server or web hosting service.\nThe publishing documentation describes several convenient options for Quarto website deployment including RStudio Connect, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Firebase, Site44, and Amazon S3. We’ll mostly defer to the documentation provided by those various services, but will note any Quarto website specific configuration required.\n\n\nDoes RStudio Connect support Quarto?\nYes! You can publish Quarto content to RStudio Connect v2021.08.0 or later. Quarto has to be enabled as documented in the RStudio Connect admin guide. Connect’s user documentation refers to Quarto.org docs on how to publish from the RStudio IDE. To publish Python-based Quarto content, you can use the rsconnect-python CLI from various locations, including VSCode, JupyterLab or the terminal.\n\n\nWho are the developers of Quarto?\nDevelopment of Quarto is sponsored by RStudio, PBC. The same core team works on both Quarto and R Markdown:\n\nCarlos Scheidegger (@cscheid)\nCharles Teague (@dragonstyle)\nChristophe Dervieux (@cderv)\nJ.J. Allaire (@jjallaire)\nYihui Xie (@yihui)\n\nHere is the full contributors list. Quarto is open source and we welcome contributions in our github repository as well! https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli.\n\n\nWhy the name Quarto?\nWe wanted to use a name that had meaning in the history of publishing and landed on Quarto, which is the format of a book or pamphlet produced from full sheets printed with eight pages of text, four to a side, then folded twice to produce four leaves. The earliest known European printed book is a Quarto, the Sibyllenbuch, believed to have been printed by Johannes Gutenberg in 1452–53.\n\n\nWhere can I report bugs or request features?\nThanks for finding something and sharing with us! You can file an issue in the Quarto repository https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues.\n\n\nWhere can I ask questions and discuss using Quarto with others?\nThe best place to ask questions and see what questions other people have is in Quarto discussions (https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions)."

If you do an incremental render of either a single document or a project sub-directory then code is always executed. For example:\n# render single document (always executes code)\nquarto render document.qmd\n\n# render project subdirectory (always executes code)\nquarto render articles\n\nUsing Freeze\nFreeze is generally used when you have either a large number of collaborators or many computational documents created over a longer period of time. In both cases it can be challenging to fully re-execute every document when you render the site. This could be because some documents have esoteric or environment-specific requirements (e.g. require access/authentication to a data source) or due to general fragility of dependencies over time. Using freeze ensures that you can always reproducibly render your site.\nThe computational results of documents executed with freeze are stored in the _freeze directory, and re-used when needed to fulfill document renders. You should check the contents of _freeze into version control so that others rendering the project don’t need to reproduce your computational environment to render it in their environment.\nNote that you’ll still want to take care to fully re-render your project when things outside of source code change (e.g. input data). You can remove previously frozen output by deleting the _freeze folder at the root of yourproject.\n\n\nVirtual Environments\nYou can also combine freeze with the use of virtual environments to divide your project into sub-directories that each have their own set of dependencies. This allows multiple collaborators to use a set of localized dependencies for the documents they are responsible for, but at the same time still be able to render the entire project without requiring all of its dependencies.\nTo learn how to create and use a virtual environment, see the full documentation on Virtual Environments\nHere’s an example workflow of using virtual environments with freeze:\n\nInclude freeze: true in the project execution options:\nexecute:\n  freeze: true\nCreate a sub-directory of documents (e.g. research), and initialize and use a virtual environment within it:\nresearch/\n  document1.qmd\n  document2.qmd\n  env/\n  requirements.txt\nWhen working wihtin this sub-directory, activate the virtual environment before rendering its documents. For example:\ncd research\nsource venv/bin/activate\nquarto render               # render all files in subdir\nquarto render document.qmd  # render a single-file\n\nThis sub-directory render won’t use the cached freeze results but instead will re-run all of the computations using the directory-specific virtual environment. You can of course also include sub-directories within this directory and their documents will also be rendered using the parent virtual environment."

For example. this command will render only the PDF format:\nquarto render --to pdf\nquarto render myproject --to pdf\nIf you are working with Quarto from R, you can also render a project from the R console using the quarto R package.\nlibrary(quarto)\nquarto_render()"

(hidden files) or _ (typically used for non top-level files, e.g. ones included in other files).\nIf you don’t want to render all of the target documents in a project, or you wish to control the order of rendering more precisely, you can add a project: render: [files] entry to your project metadata. For example:\nproject:\n  render:\n    - section1.qmd\n    - section2.qmd\nNote that you can use wildcards when defining the render list. For example:\nproject:\n  render:\n    - section*.qmd\nYou can also use the prefix ! to ignore some paths in the render list. Note that in that case you need to start by specifying everything you do want to render. For example:\nproject:\n  render:\n    - \"*.qmd\"\n    - \"!ignored.qmd\"\n    - \"!ignored-dir/\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the name of your output file needs to start with . or _ (for instance _index.md for Hugo users), you must name the Quarto input file without the prefix (for instance index.qmd) and add an explicit output-file parameter in the YAML such as\n---\noutput-file: _index.md\n---"

    "text": "Project Scripts\nMany more complex projects have additional processing that needs to take place periodically (e.g. data import and preparation) or even before/after each render. Project scripts are a way to incorporate this processing into your workflow.\n\nPeriodic Scripts\nYou can use the quarto run command to run a TypeScript, R, Python, or Lua script. For example:\nquarto run import.py\nAvailable script interpreters for quarto run include:\n\n\n\nLanguage\nInterpreter\n\n\n\n\nTypeScript\nDeno (embedded in Quarto)\n\n\nR\nRscript from PATH\n\n\nPython\nPython from PATH (or launcher on Windows)\n\n\nLua\nLua 5.3 (embedded in Pandoc)\n\n\n\nUsing TypeScript or Lua enables you to create scripts with no additional installation requirements. On the other hand, if your project is already using Python or R then scripts in those languages might be more convenient.\nIf you are using TypeScript, please be sure to consult the section below on Deno Scripts for additonal details on the Deno standard library and importing external scripts.\n\n\nPre and Post Render Scripts\nYou can arrange for one or more scripts to execute before and/or after each render using the pre-render and post-render project options. For example:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  pre-render: prepare.py\n  post-render: \n    - compress.ts\n    - fix-links.py\nNote that pre-render and post-render also support arbitrary shell commands. So you could for example use make to do data preparation this way:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  pre-render: make prepare\nPre and post render scripts are run with the main project directory.\nThe following environment variables are passed to pre and post-render scripts (note that all paths are relative to the main project directory):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nQUARTO_PROJECT_RENDER_ALL\nSet to “1” if this is a render of all files in the project (as opposed to an incremental render or a render for preview). This unset if Quarto is not rendering all files.\n\n\nQUARTO_PROJECT_OUTPUT_DIR\nOutput directory\n\n\nQUARTO_PROJECT_INPUT_FILES\nNewline separated list of all input files being rendered (passed only to pre-render)\n\n\nQUARTO_PROJECT_OUTPUT_FILES\nNewline separated list of all output files rendered (passed only to post-render).\n\n\n\nIf you have a pre-render step that is expensive, you may want only run it when the entire project is being rendered. Here’s how you would do this in the various supported script languages:\n\nTypeScriptPythonRLua\n\n\nif (!Deno.env.get(\"QUARTO_PROJECT_RENDER_ALL\")) {\n  Deno.exit();\n}\n\n\nimport os\nif not os.getenv(\"QUARTO_PROJECT_RENDER_ALL\"):\n  exit()\n\n\nif (!nzchar(Sys.getenv(\"QUARTO_PROJECT_RENDER_ALL\"))) {\n  quit()\n}\n\n\nif not os.getenv(\"QUARTO_PROJECT_RENDER_ALL\") then\n  os.exit();\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nDeno Scripts\nIf you want to create project scripts with TypeScript, quarto run enables you to use the Deno TypeScript interpreter bundled with Quarto. This interpreter also includes the complete Deno standard library. For example, to use the Deno YAML parser you would do this:\nimport { parse } from \"https://deno.land/std/encoding/yaml.ts\";\n\nconst config = parse(Deno.readTextFileSync(\"_quarto.yml\"));\nThe reference to the Deno encoding library above uses a URL: it’s important to note that in spite of this the library is not downloaded from a remote server (in fact, importing from remote servers is disabled entirely in the Quarto Deno interpreter). Rather, the Deno standard library is shipped with Quarto, making standard library URLs available in an offline cache.\nYou may come across example code that embeds versions directly in Deno library imports. For example:\nimport { format } from \"https://deno.land/std@0.119.0/datetime/mod.ts\";\nThese version-bound imports will not work with Quarto (as its local standard library cache is populated with unversioned URLs). The correct form of the above import is thus:\nimport { format } from \"https://deno.land/std/datetime/mod.ts\";\nYou may also see examples of Deno code that imports 3rd party libraries directly from URLs. As noted above, this functionality is not available in Quarto Deno scripts. Rather, you should download any external libraries you wish to use, include them with your project source code, and import them using relative file paths."

You can change the default sizes using the fig-width and fig-height options. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    fig-width: 8\n    fig-height: 6\n  pdf:\n    fig-width: 7\n    fig-height: 5\n---\nHow do these sizes make their way into the engine-level defaults for generating figures? This differs by engine:\n\nFor the Knitr engine, these values become the default values for the fig.width and fig.height chunk options. You can override these default values via chunk level options.\nFor Python, these values are used to set the Matplotlib figure.figsize rcParam (you can of course manually override these defaults for any given plot).\nFor Julia, these values are used to initialize the default figure size for the Plots.jl GR backend.\nIf you are using another graphics library with Jupyter and want to utilize these values, you can read them from QUARTO_FIG_WIDTH and QUARTO_FIG_HEIGHT environment variables.\n\n\nCaption and Alt Text\nYou can specify the caption and alt text for figures generated from code using the fig-cap and fig-alt options. For example, here we add these options to a Python code cell that creates a plot:\n```{python}\n#| fig-cap: \"Polar axis plot\"\n#| fig-alt: \"A line plot on a polar axis\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```"

Accordingly, no daemon is created when documents are rendered without an active tty or when they are part of a batch rendering (e.g. in a Quarto Project).\nNote that Quarto does not use a daemon by default on Windows (as some Windows systems will not allow the socket connection required by the daemon).\nYou can customize this behavior using the daemon execution option. Set it to false to prevent the use of a daemon, or set it to a value (in seconds) to determine the period after which the daemon will timeout (the default is 300 seconds). For example:\nexecute:\n  daemon: false\nexecute:\n  daemon: 60\nNote that if you want to use a daemon on Windows you need to enable it explicitly:\nexecute:\n  daemon: true\n\nCommand Line\nYou can also control use of the Jupyter daemon using the following command line options:\n# use a daemon w/ default timeout (300 sec)\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon\n\n# use a daemon w/ an explicit timeout\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon 60\n\n# prevent use of a daemon\nquarto render document.qmd --no-execute-daemon\nYou can also force an existing daemon to restart using the --execute-daemon-restart command line flag:\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon-restart \nThis might be useful if you suspect that the re-use of notebook sessions is causing an error.\nFinally, you can print extended debugging information about daemon usage (startup, shutdown, connections, etc.) using the --execute-debug flag:\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-debug"

Here is a simple example:\n---\ntitle: \"Plots Demo\"\nauthor: \"Norah Jones\"\ndate: \"5/22/2021\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: true\njupyter: julia-1.7\n---\n\n## Parametric Plots\n\nPlot function pair (x(u), y(u)). \nSee @fig-parametric for an example.\n\n```{julia}\n#| label: fig-parametric\n#| fig-cap: \"Parametric Plots\"\n\nusing Plots\n\nplot(sin, \n     x->sin(2x), \n     0, \n     2π, \n     leg=false, \n     fill=(0,:lavender))\n```\nYou’ll note that there are some special comments at the top of the code block. These are cell level options that make the figure cross-referenceable.\nThis document would result in the following rendered output:\n\nYou can produce a wide variety of output types from executable code blocks, including plots, tabular output from data frames, and plain text output (e.g. printing the results of statistical summaries).\nThere are many options which control the behavior of code execution and output, you can read more about them in the article on Execution Options.\n\n\n\nQuarto will automatically run computations in any markdown document that contains executable code blocks. For example, the example shown above might be rendered to varoius formats with:\nquarto render document.qmd # defaults to html\nquarto render document.qmd --to pdf\nquarto render document.qmd --to docx\nQuarto can also render any Jupyter notebook (.ipynb):\nquarto render document.ipynb\nNote that the target file (in this case document.qmd) should always be the very first command line argument.\nNote that when rendering an .ipynb Quarto will not execute the cells within the notebook by default (the presumption being that you already executed them while editing the notebook). If you want to execute the cells you can pass the --execute flag to render:\nquarto render notebook.ipynb --execute"

You can override the version of Python used by Quarto by setting the QUARTO_PYTHON environment variable.\n\n\nIJulia\nIJulia is a Julia-language execution kernel for Jupyter. You can install IJulia from within the Julia REPL as follows:\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"IJulia\")\nOnce you’ve installed IJulia Quarto has the basic components required to execute Julia cells.\n\n\nRevise.jl\nIn addition to IJulia, you’ll want to install Revise.jl and configure it for use with IJulia. Revise.jl is a library that helps you keep your Julia sessions running longer, reducing the need to restart when you make changes to code.\nQuarto maintains a persistent kernel daemon for each document to mitigate Jupyter start up time during iterative work. Revise.jl will make this persistent process robust in the face of package updates, git branch checkouts, etc. Install Revise.jl with:\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Revise\")\nTo configure Revise to launch automatically within IJulia, create a .julia/config/startup_ijulia.jl file with the contents:\ntry\n  @eval using Revise\ncatch e\n  @warn \"Revise init\" exception=(e, catch_backtrace())\nend\nYou can learn more about Revise.jl at https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl."

For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nformat: html\nexecute: \n  cache: true\n---\nYou can also specify caching at the project level. For example, within a project file:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  \nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: united\n    \nexecute:\n  cache: true\nNote that changes within a document that aren’t within code cells (e.g. markdown narrative) do not invalidate the document cache. This makes caching a very convenient option when you are working exclusively on the prose part of a document.\nJupyter Cache include a jcache command line utility that you can use to analyze and manage the notebook cache. See the Jupyter Cache documentation for additional details.\n\nRendering\nYou can use quarto render command line options to control caching behavior without changing the document’s code. Use options to force the use of caching on all chunks, disable the use of caching on all chunks (even if it’s specified in options), or to force a refresh of the cache even if it has not been invalidated:\n# use a cache (even if not enabled in options)\nquarto render example.qmd --cache \n\n# don't use a cache (even if enabled in options)\nquarto render example.qmd --no-cache \n\n# use a cache and force a refresh \nquarto render example.qmd --cache-refresh \n\n\nAlternatives\nIf you are using caching to mitigate long render-times, there are some alternatives you should consider alongside caching.\n\nDisabling Execution\nIf you are working exclusively with prose / markdown, you may want to disable execution entirely. Do this by specifying the enabled: false execute option For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nformat: html\nexecute: \n  enabled: false\n---\nNote that if you are authoring using Jupyter .ipynb notebooks (as opposed to plain-text .qmd files) then this is already the default behavior: no execution occurs when you call quarto render (rather, execution occurs as you work within the notebook).\n\n\nFreezing Execution\nIf you are working within a project and your main concern is the cumulative impact of rendering many documents at once, consider using the freeze option.\nYou can use the freeze option to denote that computational documents should never be re-rendered during a global project render, or alternatively only be re-rendered when their source file changes:\nexecute:\n  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render\nexecute:\n  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes\nNote that freeze controls whether execution occurs during global project renders. If you do an incremental render of either a single document or a project sub-directory then code is always executed. For example:\n# render single document (always executes code)\nquarto render document.qmd\n\n# render project subdirectory (always executes code)\nquarto render articles\nLearn more about using freeze with projects in the article on managing project execution."

This enables subsequent renders to proceed immediately without having to wait for kernel start-up.\nThe purpose of the daemon is to make render more responsive during interactive sessions. Accordingly, no daemon is created when documents are rendered without an active tty or when they are part of a batch rendering (e.g. in a Quarto Project).\nNote that Quarto does not use a daemon by default on Windows (as some Windows systems will not allow the socket connection required by the daemon).\nYou can customize this behavior using the daemon execution option. Set it to false to prevent the use of a daemon, or set it to a value (in seconds) to determine the period after which the daemon will timeout (the default is 300 seconds). For example:\nexecute:\n  daemon: false\nexecute:\n  daemon: 60\nNote that if you want to use a daemon on Windows you need to enable it explicitly:\nexecute:\n  daemon: true\n\nCommand Line\nYou can also control use of the Jupyter daemon using the following command line options:\n# use a daemon w/ default timeout (300 sec)\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon\n\n# use a daemon w/ an explicit timeout\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon 60\n\n# prevent use of a daemon\nquarto render document.qmd --no-execute-daemon\nYou can also force an existing daemon to restart using the --execute-daemon-restart command line flag:\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon-restart \nThis might be useful if you suspect that the re-use of notebook sessions is causing an error.\nFinally, you can print extended debugging information about daemon usage (startup, shutdown, connections, etc.) using the --execute-debug flag:\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-debug"

This is to make sure that anyone using this theme can override the variable value (without that the value is defined as not overrideable).\nYou can use a custom theme by just specifying it as the theme option (all theme files implicitly inherit from the default theme). For example:\n---\ntitle: \"Presentation\"\nformat:\n  revealjs: \n    theme: mytheme.scss\n---\nHere is the source code for all of the built-in themes for inspiration and examples:\nhttps://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/src/resources/formats/revealjs/themes"

You can customize this using the slide-level option (See the Pandoc documentation on structuring the slide show for additional details.\n\nTitle Slide\nYou’ll notice in the above examples that a title slide is automatically created based on the title and author provided in the document YAML options. However, sometimes you don’t want an explicit title slide (e.g. if your first slide consists entirely of a background image). It’s perfectly valid to create a presentation without a title slide, just exclude the title and author options:\n---\nformat: revealjs\n---\n\n## Getting up\n\n- Turn off alarm\n- Get out of bed\n\n## Going to sleep\n\n- Get in bed\n- Count sheep"

    "text": "Code Blocks\nMost of the core capabilities of Quarto HTML Code Blocks are available for Reveal slides, including code folding, code copy, and the ability to pick a custom syntax highlighting theme. Note that if you choose a dark Reveal theme then the default Quarto dark syntax highlighting theme will be used.\n\nLine Highlighting\nYou may want to highlight specific lines of code output (or even highlight distinct lines over a progression of steps). You can do this using the code-line-numbers attribute of code blocks. For example:\n```{.python code-line-numbers=\"6-8\"}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\nNote that you can also highlight disparate ranges of lines by separating them with a comma. For example:\n```{.python code-line-numbers=\"7,9\"}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\nFinally, you can highlight different line ranges progressively by separating them with |. For example, here we start by showing all lines, then progress to highlighting line 6, and finally to highlighting line 9:\n```{.python code-line-numbers=\"|6|9\"}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\nYou can use this same option within an executable code cell by using the code-line-numbers cell options:\n```{.python}\n#| echo: fenced\n#| code-line-numbers: \"|6|9\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```"

    "section": "Executable Code",
    "text": "Executable Code\nYou can include the output of executable code blocks on slides just the same as with other Quarto documents. This works essentially the same for slides as it does for other formats, however there are a couple of special considerations for slides covered below.\n\nFigure Size\nYou will frequently need to customize the size of figures created for slides so that they either fill the entire slide or whatever region of the slide you need them to. Quarto provides some help here: for Python the figure sizes for Matplotlib and Plotly Express are set to fill the slide area below the title, and for R the Knitr figure width and height are similarly defaulted.\nNevertheless, you will frequently need to change these defaults for a given figure. The details on how to do this vary by graphics library. Here’s an example of explicitly sizing an Altair plot:\nalt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(\n    x='Horsepower',\n    y='Miles_per_Gallon',\n    color='Origin',\n).properties(\n    width=700,\n    height=300\n).interactive()\n\n\nCode Echo\nUnlike with ordinary documents, within Quarto presentations executable code blocks do not echo their source code by default (this is because often the code produces a figure that wants to occupy as much vertical space as possible). You can override this behavior using the echo option. For example:\n```{python}\n#| echo: true\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={\"projection\": \"polar\"})\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\nOutput Location\nBy default, output from executable code blocks is displayed immediately after the code. You can use the output-location option to modify this behavior as follows:\n\n\n\nfragment\nDisplay output as a Fragment (delay showing it until its explicitly stepped through by advancing the slides).\n\n\nslide\nDisplay output on an entirely new slide after the current one.\n\n\ncolumn\nDisplay output in a column adjacent to the code.\n\n\ncolumn-fragment\nDisplay output in a column adjacent to the code (delay showing it until its explicitly stepped through by advancing the slides).\n\n\n\nFor example, here we display cell output on its own slide:\n```{r}\n#| output-location: slide\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\")\n```\nSee the documentation on Execution Options for more details on the various other ways to customize output from code execution."

You can apply full page backgrounds outside of the slide area by adding a background attribute to your slide headers. Four different types of backgrounds are supported: color, image, video and iframe.\nAll CSS color formats are supported, including hex values, keywords, rgba() or hsl(). For example:\n## Slide Title {background-color=\"aquamarine\"}\nYou can also use various types of media (image, video, or iframe) as your slide background. These options are described below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if the background color of your media differs from your presentation’s theme (e.g. a dark image when using a light theme) then you should also explicitly set the background-color so that text on top of the background appears in the correct color (e.g. light text on a dark background).\n\n\n\n\nImage Backgrounds\nBy default, background images are resized to cover the full page.

This is great when you want BIG text without having to manually find the right font size. For example:\n::: {.r-fit-text}\nBig Text\n:::\n\n\nStretch\nThe r-stretch layout helper lets you resize an element, like an image or video, to cover the remaining vertical space in a slide. For example, here the image will automatically be resized to fit space remaining outside of the slide title and text before and after it:\n## Slide Title\n\nHere is an image:\n\n![](image.png){.r-stretch}\n\nSome text after the image.\nFor slides that contain only a single top-level image, the .r-stretch class is automatically applied to the image.

    "section": "Auto Animate",
    "text": "Auto Animate\nRevealjs can automatically animate elements across slides. All you need to do is add the auto-animate attribute to two adjacent slides and Auto-Animate will animate all matching elements between the two.\nHere’s a simple example to give you a better idea of how it can be used. Note that the slides don’t have titles in this example (rather just the auto-animate attribute) however they could also include a title.\n## {auto-animate=true}\n\n::: {style=\"margin-top: 100px;\"}\nAnimating content\n:::\n\n## {auto-animate=true}\n\n::: {style=\"margin-top: 200px; font-size: 3em; color: red;\"}\nAnimating content\n:::\nThis example uses the margin-top property to move the element but internally Reveal will use a CSS transform to ensure smooth movement. This same approach to animation works with most animatable CSS properties meaning you can transition things like position, font-size, line-height, color, background-color, padding and margin.\n\nCode Animations\nYou can also animate between code blocks to show changes in code. For example:\n## {auto-animate=\"true\"}\n\n```r\n# Fill in the spot we created for a plot\noutput$phonePlot <- renderPlot({\n  # Render a barplot\n})\n```\n\n## {auto-animate=true}\n\n```r\n# Fill in the spot we created for a plot\noutput$phonePlot <- renderPlot({\n  # Render a barplot\n  barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region]*1000, \n          main=input$region,\n          ylab=\"Number of Telephones\",\n          xlab=\"Year\")\n})\n```\n\n\nMovement Animations\nAnimations are not limited to changes in style. Auto-Animate can also be used to automatically move elements into their new position as content is added, removed or rearranged on a slide. All without a single line of inline CSS. For example, here the delta between the content on two slides is implicitly animated:\n## {auto-animate=true}\n\nAnimation\n\n## {auto-animate=true}\n\nImplicit\n\nAnimation\n\n\nElement Matching\nWhen you navigate between two auto-animated slides we’ll do our best to automatically find matching elements in the two slides. For text, we consider it a match if both the text contents and node type are identical. For images, videos and iframes we compare the src attribute. We also take into account the order in which the element appears in the DOM.\nIn situations where automatic matching is not feasible you can give the objects that you want to animate between a matching data-id attribute. We prioritize matching data-id values above our automatic matching.\nHere’s an example where we’ve given several blocks a matching ID since automatic matching has no content to go on. This example also makes use of some additional animation attributes (auto-animate-easing and auto-animate-delay), which we’ll describe the use of in the next section.\n## {auto-animate=true auto-animate-easing=\"ease-in-out\"}\n\n::: {.r-hstack}\n::: {data-id=\"box1\" auto-animate-delay=\"0\" style=\"background: #2780e3; width: 200px; height: 150px; margin: 10px;\"}\n:::\n\n::: {data-id=\"box2\" auto-animate-delay=\"0.1\" style=\"background: #3fb618; width: 200px; height: 150px; margin: 10px;\"}\n:::\n\n::: {data-id=\"box3\" auto-animate-delay=\"0.2\" style=\"background: #e83e8c; width: 200px; height: 150px; margin: 10px;\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n## {auto-animate=true auto-animate-easing=\"ease-in-out\"}\n\n::: {.r-stack}\n::: {data-id=\"box1\" style=\"background: #2780e3; width: 350px; height: 350px; border-radius: 200px;\"}\n:::\n\n::: {data-id=\"box2\" style=\"background: #3fb618; width: 250px; height: 250px; border-radius: 200px;\"}\n:::\n\n::: {data-id=\"box3\" style=\"background: #e83e8c; width: 150px; height: 150px; border-radius: 200px;\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnimation Settings\nYou can override specific animation settings such as easing and duration either for the whole presentation, per-slide or individually for each animated element. The following configuration attributes can be used to change the settings for a specific slide or element:\n\n\n\nAttribute\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nauto-animate-easing\nease\nA CSS easing function.\n\n\nauto-animate-unmatched\ntrue\nDetermines whether elements with no matching auto-animate target should fade in. Set to false to make them appear instantly.\n\n\nauto-animate-duration\n1.0\nAnimation duration in seconds.\n\n\nauto-animate-delay\n0\nAnimation delay in seconds (can only be set for specific elements, not at the slide level).\n\n\nauto-animate-id\nabsent\nAn id tying auto-animate slides together.\n\n\nauto-animate-restart\nabsent\nBreaks apart two adjacent auto-animate slides (even with the same id).\n\n\n\nYou can override the global defaults for easing, unmatched, and duration as follows:\n---\ntitle: \"My Slide\"\nformat:\n  revealjs:\n    auto-animate-easing: ease-in-out\n    auto-animate-unmatched: false\n    auto-animate-duration: 0.8\n---"

    "text": "Vertical Slides\nReveal uses classic linear slide navigation by default. If you wish you can also configure slide navigation to nest multiple slides within a single top-level slide to create a vertical stack.\nUse the navigation-mode option to fine tune Reveal navigation behavior:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation Mode\nBehavior\n\n\n\n\nlinear\nLeft/right arrows step through all slides (both horizontal and vertical).\n\n\nvertical\nLeft/right arrow keys step between horizontal slides. Up/down arrow keys step between vertical slides. Space key steps through all slides (both horizontal and vertical).\n\n\ngrid\nWhen this is enabled, stepping left/right from a vertical stack to an adjacent vertical stack will land you at the same vertical index.\n\n\n\nIf you use vertical or grid navigation, you should structure your slides using level 1 headings for the horizontal axis and level 2 headings for the vertical axis. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"Presentation\"\nformat:\n  revealjs:\n    navigation-mode: vertical\n---\n\n# Slide 1\n\n## Slide 1.1\n\n## Slide 1.2\n\n# Slide 2\n\n## Slide 2.1\n\n## Slide 2.2\n\nSlide Controls\nWhen you enable vertical or grid navigation, controls will appear to provide a visual cue to where you are in the presentation (e.g. if there are vertical slides below you’ll see a down control).\nBy default these controls appear at the edges of the presentation, you can position them in the bottom right corner using the controls-layout option. You can also provide an extra visual cue to viewers that the controls are available using the controls-tutorial option. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"Presentation\"\nformat: \n  revealjs:\n    navigation-mode: vertical\n    controls-layout: bottom-right\n    controls-tutorial: true\n---\nNote that using controls-layout: bottom-right isn’t compatible with including a logo (as the logo appears in the bottom right corner as well).\nYou can also disable the controls entirely with controls: false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhile vertical slides do provide some additional flexibility over the traditional linear model, they are in practice very confusing for end users (mostly because they are so unexpected). Users will often skip the vertical content because they simply don’t know its there.\nIf your content benefits from vertical orientation (e.g. you have optional drill-down content that you don’t want in the main flow of the presentation) by all means use the vertical mode. Just know that if you distribute your slides to users they will very likely not end up viewing any of the vertical content."

The config file lets Quarto know how to inject the plugin into the presentation (e.g. what scripts and/or css files to include, what the default configuration should be, etc.).\nSee the source code of the plugins that are built in to Quarto Reveal for examples:\nhttps://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/src/resources/formats/revealjs/plugins\nTo use a plugin, just include a reference to its directory in the list of plugins. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"Presentation\"\nformat:\n  revealjs:\n    revealjs-plugins:\n      - myplugin\n---\nNote that many of the most popular Reveal plugins are already included with the Quarto version of Reveal, so there is no need to include them separately. Built in plugins include:\n\nMultiplex\nRevealMenu\nRevealChalkboard\nPdfExport\n\n\nExample\nLet’s show an example with the fullscreen. Here are the steps to bundle this plugin to use within your Quarto HTML presentation:\n\nCreate a folder with the name you want for the plugin, here we’ll call it fullscreen.\nDownload the plugin files into the created folder. Here the plugin only have a JS file called plugin.js that you can find on the repo rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins. You can keep the name or rename it, e.g fullscreen.js.\nIn that folder add a plugin.yml file, as in Quarto Reveal examples.\n\nname is a mandatory field which should be the name of the JS function the JS plugin is defining. Open the JS script you downloaded to look for it.\nOther fields are for the resources to be used. In our example, only a JS script so we’ll use script\n\nOur plugin.yml would be:\nname: RevealFullscreen\nscript: [fullscreen.js]\nNow add the plugin reference into your document YAML header, using the path of the folder your created:\nformat: \n revealjs:\n   revealjs-plugins:\n     - fullscreen\nThe custom plugin will be loaded in your presentation and you can use it. The plugin fullscreen documentation shows an example of adding a Map fullscreen in a slide by adding an attribute on the section, and using stretch on the content. This would translate to having this slide in the .qmd file:\n## {fullscreen=true}\n\n<iframe class=\"stretch\" data-src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m12!1m3!1d61206.89156051744!2d-151.77366863890407!3d-16.50433878928727!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sde!4v1467468929561\"></iframe>"

The multiplex plugin allows your audience to follow the slides of the presentation you are controlling on their own phone, tablet or laptop.

Just specify the multiplex: true option as follows:\n---\ntitle: \"Presentation\"\nformat:\n  revealjs:\n    multiplex: true\n---\nRendering the presentation will result in two HTML files being created by Quarto:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\nDescription\n\n\n\n\npresentation.html\nThis is the file you should publish online and that your audience should view.\n\n\npresentation-speaker.html\nThis is the file that you should present from . This file can remain on your computer and does not need to be published elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe two versions of the presentation will be synchronized such that when the speaker version switches slides the viewers also all switch to the same slide.\n\nMultiplex Server\nBehind the scenes there is a multiplex server that is synchronizing slide events between the viewer and speaker versions of the presentation. Note that the this server does not actually see any of the slide content, it is only used to synchronize events.\nBy default, a server created and hosted by the Revealjs team is used for this: https://reveal-multiplex.glitch.me/. This server is used by default when you specify multiplex: true.\n\nRunning your own server\nIf you want to run your own version of this server its source code is here: https://github.com/reveal/multiplex/blob/master/index.js.\nYou can then configure multiplex to use an alternate server as follows:\n---\ntitle: \"Presentation\"\nformat:\n  revealjs:\n    multiplex: \n      url: 'https://myserver.example.com/\n---\nNote that Quarto calls the multiplex server behind the scenes to provision a id and secret for your presentation. If you want to provision your own id and secret you can do so at https://reveal-multiplex.glitch.me/ (or using your custom hosted server URL) and provide them explicitly in YAML:\n---\ntitle: \"Presentation\"\nformat:\n  revealjs:\n    multiplex: \n      id: '1ea875674b17ca76'\n      secret: '13652805320794272084'\n---\nNote that the secret value will be included in only the speaker version of the presentation."

When converting a document from one format to another, text is parsed by a reader into pandoc’s intermediate representation of the document—an “abstract syntax tree” or AST—which is then converted by the writer into the target format. The pandoc AST format is defined in the module Text.Pandoc.Definition in the pandoc-types package.\nA “filter” is a program that modifies the AST, between the reader and the writer.\nINPUT --reader--> AST --filter--> AST --writer--> OUTPUT\nPandoc’s built-in citation processing is implemented as a filter, as are many of Quarto’s extensions (e.g. cross-references, figure layout, etc.). Some other examples include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nspellcheck\nChecks the spelling of words in the body of the document (omitting metadata).\n\n\npandoc-quotes\nReplaces non-typographic quotation marks with typographic ones for languages other than American English\n\n\n\n\nUsing Filters\nAdd one or more filters to document rendering using the filters option. For example:\nfilters:\n   - spellcheck.lua\nBy default, user filters are run after Quarto’s built-in filters. For some filters you’ll want to modify this behavior For example, here we arrange to run pandoc-quotes.lua before Quarto’s filters and spellcheck.lua after:\nfilters:\n  - pandoc-quotes.lua\n  - quarto\n  - spellcheck.lua\n\n\nWriting Filters\nYou can write Pandoc filters using Lua (via Pandoc’s built-in Lua interpreter) or using any other language using a JSON representation of the Pandoc AST piped to/from an external process.\nWe strongly recommend using Lua Filters, which have the following advantages:\n\nNo external dependencies\nHigh performance (no serialization or process execution overhead)\nAccess to Pandoc’s library of Lua helper functions.\n\nSee the documentation on Writing Lua Filters for additional details.\nIf you want to write a JSON filter, see the documentation on Writing JSON filters."

This is naturally the case for rendering .ipynb files directly, however it is also the case for .qmd files that have embedded Julia or Python cells (in which case a temporary .ipynb is constructed). This notebook is ultimately converted into markdown and then rendered by Pandoc to the specified output format(s).\nYou may wish to do some pre-processing on the notebook prior to its conversion to markdown. This can be accomplished by specifying one or or more ipynb-filters. These filters are passed the JSON representation of the notebook on stdin and should write a transformed JSON representation to stdout.\nFor example, this notebook filter uses the nbformat package to read a notebook, prepend a comment to the source of each code cell, and then write it back to stdout:\nimport sys\nimport nbformat\n\n# read notebook from stdin\nnb = nbformat.reads(sys.stdin.read(), as_version = 4)\n\n# prepend a comment to the source of each cell\nfor index, cell in enumerate(nb.cells):\n  if cell.cell_type == 'code':\n     cell.source = \"# comment\\n\" + cell.source\n  \n# write notebook to stdout \nnbformat.write(nb, sys.stdout)\nYou can arrange for this filter to be run using the ipynb-filters option (specified at either the document or project level):\n---\nipynb-filters:\n  - filter.py\n---\nNote that the current working directory for the filter will be set to the location of the input notebook."

To get started with developing shortcodes:\n\nBe sure you have a very recent version of Quarto CLI (custom shortcodes requires v0.9.341 or greater).\nRead the documentation on Pandoc Lua Filters, which describes the Lua extension API for Pandoc.\n\nCustom shortcodes are implemented as Lua functions that take one or more arguments and return a Pandoc AST node (or list of nodes).\nHere’s the implementation of the env shortcode that is built in to Quarto:\nenv.lua\nfunction env(args)\n  local var = pandoc.utils.stringify(args[1])\n  local value = os.getenv(var)\n  if value ~= nil then\n    return pandoc.Str(value)\n  else\n    return pandoc.Null()\n  end\nend\nNote that arguments to shortcodes are provided in args (a 1-based array), and that each argument is a list of Pandoc inlines (i.e. markdown AST parsed from the text).\nWe use the pandoc.utils.stringify() function to convert the inlines to an ordinary string, and then the os.getenv() function to get its value.\nIf this function was included in a source file named env.lua, you could register it for use with:\nshortcodes:\n  - env.lua\nThen use it with:\n{{< env HOME >}}\nBelow we’ll provide a few a few more examples of custom shortcodes and their implementation."

    "text": "Example: Raw Output\nShortcodes can tailor their output to the format being rendered to. This is often useful when you want to conditionally generate rich HTML output but still have the same document render properly to PDF or MS Word.\nThe pagebreak shortcode generates “native” pagebreaks in a variety of formats. Here’s the implementation of pagebreak:\npagebreak.lua\nfunction pagebreak()\n \n  local raw = {\n    epub = '<p style=\"page-break-after: always;\"> </p>',\n    html = '<div style=\"page-break-after: always;\"></div>',\n    latex = '\\\\newpage{}',\n    ooxml = '<w:p><w:r><w:br w:type=\"page\"/></w:r></w:p>',\n    odt = '<text:p text:style-name=\"Pagebreak\"/>',\n    context = '\\\\page'\n  }\n\n  if FORMAT == 'docx' then\n    return pandoc.RawBlock('openxml', raw.ooxml)\n  elseif FORMAT:match 'latex' then\n    return pandoc.RawBlock('tex', raw.latex)\n  elseif FORMAT:match 'odt' then\n    return pandoc.RawBlock('opendocument', raw.odt)\n  elseif FORMAT:match 'html.*' then\n    return pandoc.RawBlock('html', raw.html)\n  elseif FORMAT:match 'epub' then\n    return pandoc.RawBlock('html', raw.epub)\n  elseif FORMAT:match 'context' then\n    return pandoc.RawBlock('context', raw.context)\n  else\n    -- fall back to insert a form feed character\n    return pandoc.Para{pandoc.Str '\\f'}\n  end\n\nend\nWe use the pandoc.RawBlock() function to output the appropriate raw content for the target FORMAT. Note that raw blocks are passed straight through to the output file and are not processed as markdown.\nIf this function was implemented within pagebreak.lua, you could register it for use with:\nshortcodes:\n  - pagebreak.lua\nThen use it with:\n{{< pagebreak >}}"

    "text": "Example: Named Arguments\nThe examples above use either a single argument (env) or no arguments at all (pagebreak). Here we demonstrate named argument handling by implementing a git-rev shortcode that prints the current git revision, providing a short option to determine whether a short or long SHA1 is displayed:\ngit.lua\n-- run git and read its output\nfunction git(command)\n  local p = io.popen(\"git \" .. command)\n  local output = p:read('*all')\n  p:close()\n  return output\nend\n\n-- return a table containing shortcode definitions\n-- defining shortcodes this way allows us to create helper \n-- functions that are not themselves considered shortcodes \nreturn {\n  [\"git-rev\"] = function(args, kwargs)\n    -- command line args\n    local cmdArgs = \"\"\n    local short = pandoc.utils.stringify(kwargs[\"short\"])\n    if short == \"true\" then\n      cmdArgs = cmdArgs .. \"--short \"\n    end\n    \n    -- run the command\n    local cmd = \"rev-parse \" .. cmdArgs .. \"HEAD\"\n    local rev = git(cmd)\n    \n    -- return as string\n    return pandoc.Str(rev)\n  end\n}\nThere are some new things demonstrated here :\n\nRather than defining our shortcode functions globally, we return a table with the shortcode definitions. This allows us to define helper functions that are not themselves registered as shortcodes. It also enables us to define a shortcode with a dash (-) in its name.\nThere is a new argument to our shortcode handler: kwargs. This holds any named arguments to the shortcode. As with args, values in kwargs will always be a list of Pandoc inlines (allowing you to accept markdown as an argument). Since short is a simple boolean value we need to call pandoc.utils.stringify() to treat it as a string and then compare it to \"true\".\n\nWe’d register and use this shortcode as follows:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nshortcodes:\n  - git.lua\n---\n\n{{< git-rev >}}\n{{< git-rev short=true >}}"

    "text": "Example: Metadata Options\nIn some cases you may want to provide options that affect how you shortcode behaves. There is a third argument to shortcode handlers (meta) that provides access to document and/or project level metadata.\nLet’s implement a different version of the git-rev shortcode that emits the revision as a link to GitHub rather than plain text. To do this we make use of github.owner and github.repo metadata values:\ngit.lua\nfunction git(command)\n  local p = io.popen(\"git \" .. command)\n  local output = p:read('*all')\n  p:close()\n  return output\nend\n\nreturn {\n  \n  [\"git-rev\"] = function(args, kwargs, meta)\n    -- run the command\n    local rev = git(\"rev-parse HEAD\")\n    \n    -- target repo\n    local owner = pandoc.utils.stringify(meta[\"github.owner\"])\n    local repo = pandoc.utils.stringify(meta[\"github.repo\"])\n    local url = \"https://github.com/\" \n                .. owner .. \"/\" .. repo .. \"/\" .. rev \n    \n    -- return as link\n    return pandoc.Link(pandoc.Str(rev), url)\n  end\n}\nAs with args and kwargs, meta values are always provided as a list of Pandoc inlines so often need to be converted to string using pandoc.utils.stringify().\nTo use this shortcode in a document we register it, provide the GitHub info as document options, then include the shortcode where we want the link to be:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nshortcodes:\n  - git.lua\ngithub:\n  owner: quarto-dev\n  repo: quarto-cli\n---\n\n{{< git-rev >}}\nThe shortcode registration and GitHub metadata could just as well been provided in a project-level _quarto.yml file or a directory-level _metadata.yml file."

For example:\n---\ngeometry:\n  - left=.75in\n  - textwidth=4.5in\n  - marginparsep=.25in\n  - marginparwidth=2.25in\n---\nYou can use these options to control the page geometry for the built in document classes or to customize the geometry of other document classes that you may be using.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’d like to view the page geometry in your rendered PDF, you can pass showframe to the geometry option as in the below example.\n---\ngeometry:\n  - showframe\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Blocks\nWhen rendering a PDF that uses the margins for content, Quarto automatically adjusts the appearance of code blocks. Rather than having a solid background color, a left border treatment is used.\nThis enables non-breaking code to overflow into the margin without cosmetic issues created by the code block background (which does not overflow into the margin region).\nYou can disable this treatment by setting the following code-block-border-left: false in your document front matter."

For example:\n[![Elephant](elephant.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)\n\n\nFigure Alignment\nFigures are center aligned by default. Add the fig-align attribute to the image to use a different alignment. For example:\n![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\nNote that figure captions are left aligned to accommodate longer caption text (which looks odd when center aligned).\n\n\nAlt Text\nYou can add alternative text to a figure by adding the fig-alt attribute to the image. For example, the following Markdown…\n![](elephant.png){fig-alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\"}\n… will create the following HTML with the corresponding alt tag:\n<img src=\"elephant.png\" alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\">\nNote that the figure caption, title, and alt text can all be different. For example, the following code…\n![Elephant](elephant.png \"Title: An elephant\"){fig-alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\"}\n…produces this HTML:\n<img src=\"elephant.png\" title=\"Title: An elephant\" alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\">\n\n\nMultiformat Figures\nYou can write markdown that provides a distinct image file format depending on the target output format. To do this simply leave-off the extension, for example:\n![](elephant)\nBy default this will look for elephant.png, however if you are rendering to PDF it will look for elephant.pdf. You can customize this behavior using the default-image-extension option. For example:\nformat:\n  html:\n    default-image-extension: svg\n  pdf:\n    default-image-extension: tex"

    "text": "LaTeX Figures\nThis section describes some figure handling options that are specific to LaTeX output.\nOne very important thing to note is that using the fig-env and fig-pos options described below will trigger the creation of a LaTeX floating environment (most often \\begin{figure}). Depending upon where this LaTeX is generated it (e.g. is it within another \\begin{figure}) this could generate invalid LaTeX. To be on the safe side these attributes should typically only be used for images at the very top level of your document.\n\nEnvironments\nThere are a number of LaTeX packages that provide custom figure environments. For example, the mdframed package includes an mdframed environment used to enclose figures in a special border style. By default, Quarto uses the standard figure environment, but you can use the fig-env attribute to specify a custom one. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"Sidenotes\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    include-in-header: \n      text: |\n        \\usepackage{mdframed}\n---\n\n![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-env=\"mdframed\"}\n\n\nFigure Position\nThe default LaTeX figure is a floating environment, so the specific location it appears in your document will depend on its size and the nature of the other content around it. You can exercise some control over this behavior using the fig-pos option. The fig-pos option provides a placement specifier for the figure environment. For example, the ht in this LaTeX snippet is the fig-pos:\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\n\\end{figure}\nYou can specify fig-pos either at the document level, as a executable code block option, or within markdown. Here we do all three:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    fig-pos: 'h'\n---\n\n```{python}\n#| fig-pos: 't'\n\n```\n\n![](figure.png){fig.pos='b'}\nSee this article for additional details on LaTeX figure positioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigures and Code Blocks\n\n\n\nIf your figure was generated by an executable code block and the code was included in the output (echo: true), then fig-pos will be set to H by default (to try to keep it alongside the code that generated it). In all other cases, default LaTeX handing of figure position is used unless you specify an explicit fig-pos.\n\n\n\n\nPGF/TikZ Graphics\nIf you are creating LaTeX output, Quarto will automatically emit the correct LaTeX for markdown images that reference .tex files containg PGF/TikZ vector graphics. For example, the following markdown images:\n![](image1.tex)\n\n![](image2.tex){width=80%}\nWill be written to LaTeX as:\n\\input{image1.tex}\n\n\\resizebox{0.8\\linewidth}{!}{\\input{image2.tex}}\nAs shown above, width and height percentages are automatically converted to \\linewidth scaled. Alternatively you can specify custom LaTeX for the width and height arguments of \\resizebox."

In this case \"layout=\"[[1,1], [1]]\" translates to: create two rows, the first of which has two columns of equal size and the second of which has a single column.\nNote that the numbers in a row are arbitrary and don’t need to add up to a particular total. You can therefore use whatever scheme is most natural. For example, here we define columns that occupy varying percentage widths of the row:\n::: {layout=\"[[70,30], [100]]\"}\n![Surus](surus.png)\n\n![Hanno](hanno.png)\n\n![Lin Wang](lin-wang.png)\n:::\nYou can also use negative values to create space between elements. For example:\n::: {layout=\"[[40,-20,40], [100]]\"}\n![Surus](surus.png)\n\n![Hanno](hanno.png)\n\n![Lin Wang](lin-wang.png)\n:::\n\n\nVertical Alignment\nIf you have a layout with a row of images of differing heights, you can control their vertical alignment using the layout-valign attribute. A simple example:\n::: {layout=\"[25,-2,10]\" layout-valign=\"bottom\"}\n![Surus](surus.png)\n\n![Lin Wang](lin-wang.png)\n:::\n\nNote that vertical alignment isn’t limited to images, you can also vertically align any other elements that are included in a panel."

To do this, enclose the figures in a div (with its own label and caption) and give each subfigure its own label and (optionally) caption. You can then refer to either the entire figure in a reference or a single subfigure:\n::: {#fig-elephants layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Surus](surus.png){#fig-surus}\n\n![Hanno](hanno.png){#fig-hanno}\n\nFamous Elephants\n:::\n\nSee @fig-elephants for examples.

To do this use fig-cap for the main caption, and fig-subcap to provide an array of subcaptions. For example:\n```{python}\n#| label: fig-plots\n#| fig-cap: \"Plots\" \n#| fig-subcap:\n#|   - \"Plot 1\"\n#|   - \"Plot 2\" \n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1,23,2,4])\nplt.show()\n\nplt.plot([8,65,23,90])\nplt.show()\n```\n\nSee @fig-plots for examples.

Each citation must have a key, composed of ‘@’ + the citation identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a locator, and a suffix. The citation key must begin with a letter, digit, or _, and may contain alphanumerics, _, and internal punctuation characters (:.#$%&-+?<>~/).

By default, Pandoc will use the Chicago Manual of Style author-date format, but you can specify a custom formatting using CSL (Citation Style Language). To provide a custom citation stylesheet, provide a path to a CSL file using the csl metadata field in your document, for example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: nature.csl\n---\nYou can find CSL files or learn more about using styles at the CSL Project. You can browse the list of more than 8,500 Creative Commons CSL definitions in the CSL Project’s central repository or Zotero’s style repository.\n\n\n\nPandoc will automatically generate a list of works cited and place it in the document if the style calls for it. It will be placed in a div with the id refs if one exists:\n### References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\nIf no such div is found, the works cited list will be placed at the end of the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can suppress generation of a bibliography by including suppress-bibliography: true option in your document metadata\n\n\nHere’s an example of a generated bibliography:\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” The Computer Journal 27 (2): 97–111.\n\n\nWickham, Hadley. 2015. R Packages. 1st ed. O’Reilly Media, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can define a dummy nocite metadata field and put the citations there:\n---\nnocite: |\n  @item1, @item2\n---\n\n@item3\nIn this example, the document will contain a citation for item3 only, but the bibliography will contain entries for item1, item2, and item3.\nIt is possible to create a bibliography with all the citations, whether or not they appear in the document, by using a wildcard:\n---\nnocite: |\n  @*\n---\n\n\n\nWhen creating PDFs, you can choose to use either the default Pandoc citation handling based on citeproc, or alternatively use natbib or BibLaTeX. This can be controlled using the cite-method option. For example:\nformat:\n  pdf: \n    cite-method: biblatex\nThe default is to use citeproc (Pandoc’s built in citation processor).\nSee the main article on using Citations with Quarto for additional details on citation syntax, available bibliography formats, etc.\n\n\n\nWhen using natbib or biblatex you can specify the following additional options to affect how bibliographies are rendered:\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nbiblatexoptions\nList of options for biblatex\n\n\nnatbiboptions\nList of options for natbib\n\n\nbiblio-title\nTitle for bibliography\n\n\nbiblio-style\nStyle for bibliography"

The title block contains the title, subtitle, authors, date, doi, and abstract.\nA simple example title block looks like:\n\nThe title block will automatically layout elements from the front matter of the document. If you’d like, you can control the behavior using title-block-style.\nThere are three options available:\n\ndefault\n\nThe default title-block treatment create a smaller font face and gathers the various title elements into stylized groups in the title block of the document.\n\nplain\n\nThe plain treatment will do all the title element processing (gathering and organizing the elements), but will not apply the default title block styling.\n\nnone\n\nnone disables title block processing altogether. Content will not be processed or organized and the title block will be emitted verbatim from Pandoc.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, if you’d like a more prominent title block, you can use title-block-banner to create a banner style title block. A banner style title block will position the title, subtitle, description, and categories in a banner above the article. For example:\n---\ntitle-block-banner: true\n---\nwill render a title block like:\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the color of the banner is automatically determined based upon the theme. However, you can control the banner background by providing either a CSS color (e.g. \"#FFDDFF\", or red) or the path to an image which will be used the background. For example, to use a banner image, you might write:\n---\ntitle-block-banner: images/banner.jpeg\n---\nwhich would render a banner title block like:\n\nWhen you provide an explicit background color or image, Quarto assumes that the color of the background will contrast with the body background color and automatically uses the body background color as the text color over the banner.\n\n\n\nYou can specify the color the for the text of the banner as well, using title-block-banner-color and providing a CSS color (e.g. \"#FFDDFF\", or red) .\n\n\n\nQuarto includes the document’s date in the title block. In addition to writing a standard date, you may also use a few special keywords which will generate a date for you. today will provide the current date with the current time, now will provide the current date and time, and last-modified will provide the file modification date and time of the document itself.\n\n\nWhen your title block is output using the default or plain styles, Quarto will automatically format the date based upon the document locale (lang). You can control formatting by specifying a date-format in the document front matter. For example:\n---\ntitle: Summarizing Output for Reproducible Documents\ndate: 2018-05-04\ndate-format: short\n---\nFor more about date formats, see the Quarto date format reference."

    "text": "Markdown Tables\nThe most commonly used markdown table is known as a pipe table. Pipe tables support specifying per column alignment as well as captions. For example:\n| Default | Left | Right | Center |\n|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|\n| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |\n| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |\n| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |\n\n: Demonstration of pipe table sytnax\nHere is the table rendered to HTML:\n\nDemonstration of pipe table syntax\n\n\nDefault\nLeft\nRight\nCenter\n\n\n\n\n12\n12\n12\n12\n\n\n123\n123\n123\n123\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\nThe beginning and ending pipe characters are optional, but pipes are required between all columns. The colons indicate column alignment as shown. The header cannot be omitted, however you can simulate a headerless table by including a header with blank cells.\nSince the pipes indicate column boundaries, columns need not be vertically aligned, as they are in the above example. So, this is a perfectly legal (though ugly) pipe table:\nfruit| price\n-----|-----:\napple|2.05\npear|1.37\norange|3.09\nThe cells of pipe tables cannot contain block elements like paragraphs and lists, and cannot span multiple lines. If a pipe table contains a row whose markdown content is wider than the column width (see columns option), then the table will take up the full text width and the cell contents will wrap, with the relative cell widths determined by the number of dashes in the line separating the table header from the table body.\nFor example ---|- would make the first column 3/4 and the second column 1/4 of the full text width. On the other hand, if no lines are wider than column width, then cell contents will not be wrapped, and the cells will be sized to their contents.\n\nAuthoring\nFor simple tables with only a few cells it’s straightforward to create them directly in markdown. As tables get larger, it makes sense to use an authoring tool. Some table authoring tools to consider include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTablesGenerator\nOnline tool for generating markdown tables\n\n\nEmacs TableMode\nText based table creation and editing capabilities for Emacs.\n\n\nQuarto Visual Editor\nVisual editor for .qmd files with table editing support."

    "text": "Column Widths\nAbove we describe a means of specifying column widths using the relative number of dashes in each column header (e.g. ---|- to get a 75% / 25% split for a two-column table).\nYou can also explicitly specify columns widths using the tbl-colwidths attribute or document-level option. For an individual markdown table, add the attribute after the caption. For example:\n| fruit  | price  |\n|--------|--------|\n| apple  | 2.05   |\n| pear   | 1.37   |\n| orange | 3.09   |\n\n: Fruit prices {tbl-colwidths=\"[75,25]\"}\nIf your table doesn’t have a caption, then you can still specify only tbl-colwidths:\n: {tbl-colwidths=\"[75,25]\"}\nColumn widths can also be specified at the document level (e.g. to have uniform widths across a set of tables):\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nformat: html\ntbl-colwidths: [75,25]\n---"

To do this, create a div with a main identifier, then apply sub-identifiers (and optional caption text) to the contained tables. For example:\n::: {#tbl-panel layout-ncol=2}\n| Col1 | Col2 | Col3 |\n|------|------|------|\n| A    | B    | C    |\n| E    | F    | G    |\n| A    | G    | G    |\n\n: First Table {#tbl-first}\n\n| Col1 | Col2 | Col3 |\n|------|------|------|\n| A    | B    | C    |\n| E    | F    | G    |\n| A    | G    | G    |\n\n: Second Table {#tbl-second}\n\nMain Caption\n:::\n\nSee @tbl-panel for details, especially @tbl-second.\nWhich looks like this when rendered to HTML:\n\nNote that the “Main Caption” for the table is provided as the last block within the containing div."

For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nfrom: markdown+emoji\n---\n\n\nUnicode Symbols\nTo insert an arbitrary Unicode character, use Insert -> Special Characters -> Unicode…:\n\nYou can search for characters either by name or by entering an explicit Unicode code point (e.g. “U+0420”).\n\n\nSmart Punctuation\nWhen the Pandoc smart extension is enabled (which it is by default), straight quotes are interpreted as curly quotes, --- as em-dashes, -- as en-dashes, and ... as ellipses. In addition, non-breaking spaces are inserted after certain abbreviations, such as “Mr.”\nVisual mode supports these same transformations (so when you type --- it becomes an em-dash). If you didn’t intend for this transformation to occur just hit backspace and it will be reverted."

    "section": "CSS Styles",
    "text": "CSS Styles\nOne of the benefits of authoring with markdown is that your content can be easily published to a wide variety of formats. This is possible in significant measure because of the limitations that markdown imposes: you author in terms of the structure and semantics of your content, rather than worrying about specifically how things will appear.\nSometimes however you know that you’ll be publishing to HTML, and you want to exert more control over how things look. In this case, you can use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) along with markdown to do custom formatting. This section covers how to:\n\nDefine CSS styles for your document; and\nApply those styles to entities within your document.\n\nIf you are new to CSS, you may want to brush up on the basics before proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS styles apply only to HTML output, and will not have any impact on the formatting of other output types like PDF or MS Word.\n\n\n\n\nDefining Styles\nThe best way to include CSS styles is to create an external stylesheet (e.g. styles.css), then include it within the output options of your document. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"CSS Demo\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    css: styles.css\n---\nThe styles.css file might look something like this:\n.important {\n  color: maroon;\n}\n\n.illustration {\n  border: 1px solid rgb(230, 230, 230); \n}\nNote that it’s also possible to define styles inline with a CSS code chunk, but we recommend using an external file for easier manageability.\nWithin a markdown document you can apply one or more CSS classes to various document entities including headings, images, divs, and spans. CSS classes are applied using pandoc attributes. Once you’ve applied a class to an entity, it will derive its formatting from the CSS properties of the specified class.\n\n\nHeadings\nTo add a CSS class to a heading, use the edit button at the top right of the heading that appears when your cursor is within it (or use the F4 keyboard shortcut):\n\nNote the presence of the .important class within the Edit Attributes dialog.\nCSS classes applied to headings affect all content beneath the heading (an HTML <section> tag is wrapped around the content by Pandoc), so heading classes are a great way to provide custom styles for entire sections of your document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the visual editor doesn’t currently render content using styles applied through CSS classes so you won’t see the custom formatting while editing. You will however see it when rendering and previewing the HTML version of the document.\n\n\n\n\n\nImages\nYou can apply CSS classes to images (for example, to give them a special border) using the standard Image dialog. To do this, double-click the image (or use the F4 shortcut with the image selected) and apply the desired classes:\n\nNote again that the visual editor won’t display your image with the applied CSS classes while editing, however when actually rendering the document to HTML you’ll see the styles reflected.\n\n\nDivs\nDivs are special entities that allow you to apply identifiers and/or styles to a region of a document. Divs are block elements (like paragraphs).\nYou can create divs using the Insert -> Div command, and you can apply attributes (including CSS classes) to divs the same way as you apply attributes to headings (clicking the edit button or using the F4 keyboard shortcut when you are within a div):\n\nNote the presence of the .important class within the Div Attributes dialog.\n\n\nSpans\nSpan are special entities that allow you to apply identifiers and/or styles to a region of text. Spans are inline formatting marks (like bold or italic).\nSpans can be created by selecting text and using the Format -> Span command:\n\nHere we’ve applied a span to the text “customize PDF reports” and we’ve used the span to apply the .important CSS class. Note that as with headings and images the formatting is not displayed in the visual editor, but will be visible when the document is rendered."

    "text": "The Quarto visual editor generates markdown using Pandoc. This means that in some cases your markdown will be rewritten to conform to standard Pandoc idioms. For example, Pandoc inserts 3 spaces after list bullets and automatically escapes characters that might be used for markdown syntax.\nHere is a list of conventions for Pandoc generated markdown that might differ from your own markdown writing style:\n\n*text* is used in preference to _text_\nBacktick code blocks are written as ``` {.md} rather than ```md\nBacktick code blocks with no attributes are rendered as 4-space indented code blocks\nHorizontal rules are written as dashes spanning the full width of the document\nPlain links are written as <https://yihui.org> rather than https://yihui.org\nBullet and numbered lists use additional leading spaces before list item content\nThe blockquote character (>) is included on each new line of a blockquote\nTable captions are written below rather than above tables\nMultiline HTML and TeX blocks use the explicit raw attribute (e.g. ```{=tex})\nInline footnotes are replaced with footnotes immediately below the paragraph\nNested divs use ::: at all levels so long as their attributes are distinct\nUnnumbered sections are designated with {.unnumbered} rather than {-}\nCharacters used for markdown syntax (e.g. *, _, or #) are always escaped\n\nWhile some of this behavior might be bothersome at first, if you decide that visual editing mode is useful for your workflow it’s probably best to just adapt to writing your own markdown the same way that Pandoc does. Note that you can also configure source mode to write markdown using these conventions, ensuring that the same markdown is written no matter which mode edits originate from."

    "title": "Markdown Output",
    "section": "Writer Options",
    "text": "Writer Options\nSome aspects of markdown output can be customized via global, project, or file-level options, including:\n\nHow to wrap / break lines (fixed column, sentence-per-line, etc.).\nWhere to write footnotes (below the current paragraph or section, or at the end of the document).\nWhether to use the visual mode markdown writer when saving markdown from source mode (to ensure consistency between documents saved from either mode).\n\nYou can set these options within the R Markdown Global Options or Project Options, or can alternatively set them on a per-file basis using YAML (as described below).\n\nLine Wrapping\nBy default, the visual editor writes Markdown with no line wrapping (paragraphs all occupy a single line). This matches the behavior of markdown source editing mode within RStudio.\nHowever, if you prefer to insert line breaks at a particular column (e.g. 72 or 80), or to insert a line break after each sentence, you can set a global or per-project editor option to this effect.\nYou can also set this behavior on a per-document basis via the wrap option. For example, to wrap lines after 72 characters you would use this:\n---\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: 72\n---\nTo insert a line break after each sentence, use wrap: sentence. For example:\n---\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: sentence\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithm used for sentence wrapping will handle English and Japanese text well, but may not detect the end of sentences accurately for other languages.\n\n\n\nIf you have enabled a global line wrapping option and want to turn off wrapping for a given document, use wrap: none.\n\n\nReferences\nBy default, references are written at the end of the block where their corresponding footnote appears. You can override this behavior using the references option.\nFor example, to write references at the end of sections rather than blocks you would use:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    references: \n      location: block\n---\nValid values for the references option are block, section, and document.\nNote that you can also set a global or per-project editor option to control reference writing behavior.\nIf you are aggregating a set of markdown documents into a larger work, you may want to make sure that reference identifiers are unique across all of your documents (e.g. you don’t want to have [^1] appear multiple times). You can ensure uniqueness via the prefix option. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    references: \n      location: block\n      prefix: \"mydoc\"\n---\nThis will result in footnotes in this document using the specified prefix (e.g. [^mydoc-1]), ensuring they are globally unique across the manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you are within a Quarto book project then a references prefix is applied automatically so no changes to editor_options are required.\n\n\n\n\n\nCanonical Mode\nIf you have a workflow that involves editing in both visual and source mode, you may want to ensure that the same markdown is written no matter which mode edits originate from. You can accomplish this using the canonical option. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: 72\n    references: \n      location: block\n    canonical: true\n---\nWith canonical: true, edits in visual mode and source mode will result in identical markdown output. This is especially useful if you have multiple authors collaborating using version control, with a mixture of source and visual mode editing among the authors."

Add a bibliography to your document using the bibliography YAML metadata field. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\nlink-citations: true\n---\nNote that we’ve also specified the link-citations option, which will make your citations hyperlinks to the corresponding bibliography entries.\nSee the Pandoc Citations documentation for additional information on bibliography formats.\n\n\nInserting Citations\nYou insert citations by either using the Insert -> Citation command or by using markdown syntax directly (e.g. [@cite] or @cite) .\nCitations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed of ‘@’ + the citation identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a locator, and a suffix. The citation key must begin with a letter, digit, or _, and may contain alphanumerics, _, and internal punctuation characters (:.#$%&-+?<>~/). Here are some examples:\n\n  \n    Blah Blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, chap. 1].\n  \n\n\n  Blah Blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and passim].\n  \n\n\n  Blah Blah [@smith04;\n  @doe99].\n\n  Smith says blah [-@smith04].\n  \n\nYou can also write in-text citations, as follows:\n\n  \n    @smith04 says blah.\n  \n  \n    @smith04 [p. 33] says blah.\n  \n\nSee the Pandoc Citations documentation for additional information on citation syntax.\nUse the  toolbar button or the ⇧⌘ F8 keyboard shortcut to show the Insert Citation dialog:\n\nNote that you can insert multiple citations by using the add button on the right side of the item display.\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nYou can also insert citations directly using markdown syntax (e.g. [@cite]). When you do this a completion interface is provided for searching available citations:\n\n\n\nCitation IDs\nBefore inserting a citation from an external source you will may wish to customize its ID. Within the Insert Citation dialog, click the edit button on the right side of citations to change their ID:\n\nIf you insert a new citation via code completion, you will also be provided with the opportunity to change its default citation ID.\nFor citations inserted from Zotero, you can also use the Better BibTeX plugin to generate citation IDs (this can be enabled via Citation Options if you have Better BibTeX installed).\n\n\nCitation Preview\nOnce you’ve inserted a citation, place the cursor over it to see a preview of it along with a link to the source if one is available:\n\n\n\n\nCitations from DOIs\nUse the From DOI pane of the Insert Citation dialog to insert a citation based on a DOI (e.g that you have retrieved from a PubMed or other search):\n\nIf you are using markdown syntax, you can also paste a DOI after the [@ and it will be looked up:\n\nOnce you’ve confirmed that it’s the correct work (and possibly modified the suggested ID), the citation will be inserted into the document and an entry for the work added to your bibliography.\n\n\nCitations from Search\nUse the Crossref, DataCite, and PubMed panes of the Insert Citation dialog to search one of those services for a citation:\n\nItems inserted from a search will automatically be added to your bibliography.\nNote that for PubMed queries you can use the full supported query syntax. For example, this query searches on the author and title fields: Peterson[Author] AND Embolism[Title]. You can learn more about building PubMed queries here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/advanced/.\n\n\nCitations from Zotero\nZotero is a popular free and open source reference manager. If you use Zotero, you can also insert citations directly from your Zotero libraries. If you have Zotero installed locally its location will be detected automatically and citations from your main library (My Library) will be available:\n\nZotero references will also show up automatically in completions:\n\nItems from Zotero will appear alongside items from your bibliography with a small “Z” logo juxtaposed over them. If you insert a citation from Zotero that isn’t already in your bibliography then it will be automatically added to the bibliography.\nIf you are running both RStudio and Zotero on your desktop, then no additional configuration is required for connecting to your Zotero library. If however you using RStudio Server and/or want to access your Zotero library over the web, then a few more steps are required (see the Zotero Web API section for details).\n\nGroup Libraries\nZotero Groups provide a powerful way to share collections with a class or work closely with colleagues on a project. By default, Zotero Group Libraries are not included in the Insert Citation dialog or citation completions. However, there are options available to use group libraries at a global, per-project, or per-document level.\nFor example, here we specify a project-level option to use the Reproducible Research Series (Year 1) group library:\n\nYou can also specify one or more libraries within YAML. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"Reproducible Research\"\nzotero: \"Reproducible Research Series (Year 1)\"\n---\nNote that you can also turn off Zotero entirely for a document using zotero: false:\n---\ntitle: \"Reproducible Research\"\nzotero: false\n---\n\n\nZotero Web API\nIf you are using RStudio Server and/or don’t have Zotero installed locally, you can still access your Zotero library using the Zotero Web API (assuming you have a Zotero web account and have synced your libraries to your account).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are running RStudio Desktop, it’s generally easier to also run Zotero on your desktop and access your library locally. That said, it is possible to access Zotero web libraries from RStudio Desktop if you prefer that configuration.\n\n\n\n\nAPI Access Key\nRStudio accesses Zotero web libraries using the Zotero Web API, so the first step is to create a Zotero account and then configure Zotero to sync its data to your account. You can do this using the Sync tab of the Zotero preferences:\n\nOnce you’ve configured your library to sync, you need to create a Zotero API Key to use with RStudio:\n\nFollow the instructions to create a new access key. Note that if you want to use Group Libraries with RStudio that you should change the default to provide read-only access to groups (as illustrated above).\nBe sure to record your key after generating it (i.e. copy it to the clipboard and/or save it somewhere more permanent) as you won’t be able to view it again after you navigate away.\nFinally, go to the R Markdown -> Citations preferences to connect Zotero to RStudio using your key:\n\nSet the Zotero Library option to “Web”, then paste in your Zotero Web API Key. You can use Verify Key… button to confirm that your Zotero API key is working correctly.\nOnce you’ve confirmed your connection you are ready to start inserting citations from Zotero."

    "section": "Render & Server Contexts",
    "text": "Render & Server Contexts\nTo break this down more clearly, let’s revisit the “Hello, Shiny” document we started with in the introduction to interactive documents:\n---\ntitle: \"Old Faithful\"\nformat: html\nserver: shiny\n---\n\n```{r}\nsliderInput(\"bins\", \"Number of bins:\", \n            min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)\nplotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| context: server\noutput$distPlot <- renderPlot({\n  x <- faithful[, 2]  # Old Faithful Geyser data\n  bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)\n  hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')\n})\n```\nHere is how execution breaks down for this document:\n\nThe first code chunk that contains the calls to sliderInput() and plotOutput() will execute when you render the document (e.g. quarto render old-faithful.qmd).\nThe second code chunk with the context: server option will not execute at render time, but rather will execute only when the document is served.\n\nIt’s critical to understand that the two chunks are run in completely separate R sessions. That means that you cannot access variables created in the first chunk within the second, and vice-versa. The is analogous to the ui.R and server.R scripts that compose most normal Shiny applications.\nOf course, it’s quite useful to be able to re-use code between contexts, and we’ll cover some ways to do this in the Sharing Code section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make the code of interactive documents straightforward to understand and work with, we strongly recommend that your server contexts (there can be more than one) be located at the bottom of the document. This makes the separate execution environments more clear in the flow of the document source code.\n\n\n\n\nserver.R\nThere is one other option if you prefer to have a stronger separation. You can restrict your .qmd file to only code that will execute at render time, and then split out the server code into a separate server.R file.\nRe-writing our example in this fashion would look like this:\n\nold-faithful.qmd\n---\ntitle: \"Old Faithful\"\nformat: html\nserver: shiny\n---\n\n```{r}\nsliderInput(\"bins\", \"Number of bins:\", \n            min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)\nplotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n```\n\n\nserver.R\nfunction(input, output, session) {\n  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({\n    x <- faithful[, 2]  # Old Faithful Geyser data\n    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)\n    hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')\n  })\n}\nThis is perhaps a bit less convenient but does align better with the traditional ui.R / server.R separation that exists in traditional Shiny applications."

    "section": "Sharing Code",
    "text": "Sharing Code\nSharing code between rendering contexts works a bit differently depending on if your code is in a single .qmd file or if it uses server.R. We’ll cover both scenarios below.\n\nSingle File\n\ncontext: setup\nTo have code execute in both rendering and serving contexts, create a code chunk with context: setup. For example:\n```{r}\n#| context: setup\n#| include: false\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# load data\ndataset <- import_data(\"data.csv\")\ndataset <- sample_n(dataset, 1000)\n```\nThis code will execute at both render time as well as when the server is created for each new user session. Note that we also specify include: false to make sure that code, warnings, and output from the chunk are not included in the rendered document.\n\n\ncontext: data\nThe loading and manipulation of data often dominates the startup time of Shiny applications. Since interactive documents are executed in two phases (the initial render and then the serving of the document to users) we can perform the expensive data manipulations during rendering and then simply load the data when starting up the application.\nYou can define prerendered data by adding the context: data option to an R code chunk. The chunk will be executed during render and any R objects it creates will be saved to an .RData file, which will then be loaded during Shiny server startup. For example, we could take the the setup chunk illustrated above and factor out the data loading into its own chunk:\n```{r}\n#| context: data\n#| include: false\n\ndataset <- import_data(\"data.csv\")\ndataset <- sample_n(dataset, 1000)\n```\nNote that R objects created within a context: data chunk are available to both the UI rendering and server contexts.\n\n\nKnitr cache\nYou can further improve the performance of data rendering by adding the cache: true option to the data chunk. This will cause the code chunk to be re-executed only when required. For example:\n```{r}\n#| context: data\n#| include: false\n#| cache: true\n#| cache.extra: !expr file.info(\"data.csv\")$mtime\n\ndataset <- import_data(\"data.csv\")\ndataset <- sample_n(dataset, 1000)\n```\nIn this example the cache will be invalidated if either the R code in the chunk changes or the modification time of the “data.csv” file changes (this is accomplished using the cache.extra option).\nYou can also invalidate an existing cache by removing the _cache directory alongside with your interactive document.\n\n\ncontext: server-start\nThere is one additional execution context that enables you to share code and data across multiple user sessions. Chunks with context: server-start executee once when the Shiny document is first run and are not re-executed for each new user of the document. Using context: server-start is appropriate for several scenarios including:\n\nEstablishing shared connections to remote servers (e.g. databases, Spark contexts, etc.).\nCreating reactive values intended to be shared across sessions (e.g. with reactivePoll or reactiveFileReader).\n\nFor example:\n```{r}\n#| context: server-start\n\nlibrary(DBI)\ndb <- dbConnect(...)\n```\n\n\n\nMultiple Files\nIf your interactive document uses a .qmd file to define the user-interface and a server.R file for the server, you can put shared code in a file named global.R. Functions and variables defined within global.R will be available both during render as well as during execution of the server.\nIn this scenario your interactive document consists of 3 source files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndoc.qmd\nMarkdown content as well as Shiny inputs and outputs (e.g. sliderInput(), plotOutput(), etc.)\n\n\nserver.R\nMain server function with reactive expressions, assignments to outputs, etc.\n\n\nglobal.R\nCode shared between doc.qmd and server.R."

    "text": "Cell Execution\nA critical difference between OJS cell execution and traditional notebooks is that in OJS cells do not need to be defined in any particular order.\nBecause execution is fully reactive, the runtime will automatically execute cells in the correct order based on how they reference each other. This is more akin to a spreadsheet than a traditional notebook with linear cell execution.\nFor example, in this cell we reference a variable that is not yet defined (it’s defined immediately below):\n\n```{ojs}\nx + 5\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{ojs}\nx = 10\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code works because the Observable runtime automatically determines the correct order of execution for the cells."

    "text": "Cell Output\nBy default, OJS cells show their full source code and output within rendered documents. Depending on the type of document you are creating you might want to change this behavior either globally or for individual cells.\n\nCode Visibility\nThe echo option controls whether cells display their source code. To prevent display of code for an entire document, set the echo: false option in YAML metadata:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n---\nYou can also specify this option on a per-cell basis. For example:\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: false\ndata = FileAttachment(\"palmer-penguins.csv\").csv({ typed: true })\n```\n\n\nOutput Visibility\nOJS cell output is also displayed by default. You can change this at a global or (more likely) per-cell level using the output option. For example, here we disable output for a cell:\n```{ojs}\n//| output: false\ndata\n```\nNote that cells which only carry assignments do not print their output by default. For example, this assignment won’t print anything:\n\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: fenced\ndummy1 = \"aHiddenAssignment\"\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to print even the results of assignments, you can specify the output: all option. For example:\n\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: fenced\n//| output: all\ndummy2 = [{key: 1, value: [1, 2, [3, 4], dummy1]}]\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you click the inspector you’ll see it expand to reveal the data as JSON.\n\n\nCode Display\nWe talked about showing and hiding source code above, but what about controlling exactly how it’s displayed?\nThere are options available for customizing the appearance of code blocks (highlighting, background, border, etc.) as well as how horizontal overflow is handled. See the article on HTML Code Blocks for all of the details.\nOne option we wanted to specifically highlight here is code folding, which enables you to collapse code but still provide an option for users to view it. This is especially handy for custom JavaScript visualizations as they often span dozens of lines of code.\nAdd the code-fold: true option to a code cell to enable code folding (you can also enable this globally). For example, click the “Code” button to show the code block (note the code-fold: true option is specified)\n\n\nCode\n```{ojs}\n//| code-fold: true\npdata = FileAttachment(\"palmer-penguins.csv\").csv({typed: true})\n\nPlot.plot({\n  facet: {\n    data: pdata,\n    x: \"sex\",\n    y: \"species\",\n    marginRight: 80\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.frame(),\n    Plot.rectY(pdata, \n      Plot.binX(\n        {y: \"count\"}, \n        {x: \"body_mass\", thresholds: 20, fill: \"species\"}\n      )\n    ),\n    Plot.tickX(pdata, \n      Plot.groupZ(\n        {x: \"median\"}, \n        {x: \"body_mass\",\n         z: d => d.sex + d.species,\n         stroke: \"#333\",\n         strokeWidth: 2\n        }\n      )\n    )\n  ]\n})\n```"

You can perform this preprocessing during document render (in an {r} or {python} code cell) and then make it available to {ojs} cells via the ojs_define() function.\nHere’s an example. We’ll read the same data into R, do some grouping and summarization, then make it available to OJS using ojs_define:\n\n```{r}\n#| output: false\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nco2 = read_csv(\"co2_mm.csv\")  %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarize(max = max(average))\n\nojs_define(co2data = co2)\n```\n\nNote that we could have done the same thing using Python (the ojs_define function is available in any document that uses R or Python).\nNow we plot the data using Observable Plot:\n\n```{ojs}\nyearlyChart = Plot.plot({\n  marks: [\n    Plot.line(transpose(co2data), \n      {x: \"year\", y: \"max\"}, \n      { stroke: \"black\" }\n    )\n  ]}\n)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the NOAA C02 example for the full source code.\n\nTranspose\nYou’ll note one additional twist in the OJS code above: we call the transpose function on our co2data before plotting it. The transpose function is built in to Quarto’s OJS engine, and will convert column-oriented datasets (like the ones used in Python and R) into the row-oriented datasets used by many JavaScript plotting libraries (including Plot).\nFor example, the following JSON data emitted from R or Python:\n{\n  \"year\": [1958, 1959, 1960],\n  \"max\":  [317.51, 318.29, 320.04]\n}\nIs converted to the following via the call to transpose:\n[\n  { \"year\": 1959, \"max\": 317.51 },\n  { \"year\": 1960, \"max\": 318.29 },\n  { \"year\": 1960, \"max\": 320.04 }\n]\nCheck the documentation for whatever plotting library you are using from OJS to see whether a call to transpose is required."

Returning to the sunburst example from above, here we import a notebook and use the with keyword to provide our own value for data:\n\n```{ojs}\npdata = FileAttachment(\"population.json\").json()\nimport { chart } with { pdata as data } from \"@d3/zoomable-sunburst\"\nchart\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne important restriction to be aware of is that not all notebooks published on ObservableHQ have an open-source license. Notebooks need to explicitly tagged with a license as an indication that it’s okay to use them outside of ObservableHQ.\nYou can see the license for a notebook in its header area. For, example this notebook is tagged with the ISC license:\n\nYou should check the license of ObservableHQ notebooks before you import them. See the documentation on notebook licenses for additional details on how to do this."

On the client we have familiar looking OJS inputs and a plot laid out using panel: sidebar and panel: fill:\n```{ojs}\n//| panel: sidebar\nvars = [\"Sepal.Length\", \"Sepal.Width\", \"Petal.Length\", \"Petal.Width\"]\nviewof xcol = Inputs.select(vars, {label: \"X Variable\"})\nviewof ycol = Inputs.select(vars, {label: \"Y Variable\", value: vars[1]})\nviewof count = Inputs.range([1, 9], {label: \"Cluster Count\", step: 1, value: 3})\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| panel: fill\nPlot.plot({\n  color: {\n    type: \"ordinal\",\n    scheme: \"category10\"\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.dot(transpose(selectedData), {\n      x: xcol,\n      y: ycol,\n      fill: (d, i) => clusters.cluster[i],\n    }),\n    Plot.dot(clusters.centers, { \n      x: d => d[0],\n      y: d => d[1],\n      r: 10,\n      stroke: \"black\",\n      fill: (d, i) => i + 1\n    }),\n  ]\n})\n```\nNote that the plotting code references the variables selectedData and clusters. These will be provided by reactive expressions within the Shiny server code. Note also that we use the transpose() function to reshape the data into the row-oriented format that the Plot library expects.\nHere is the server code:\n```{r}\n#| context: server\n\nselectedData <- reactive({\n  iris[, c(input$xcol, input$ycol)]\n})\n\nclusters <- reactive({\n  kmeans(selectedData(), input$count)\n})\n\nojs_define(selectedData, clusters)\n```\nWe designate this code as running on the server via the context: server option.\nNote that we reference several inputs that were defined by viewof expressions on the client (e.g. input$xcol). When these inputs change they will cause the appropriate server side reactives to re-execute.\nWe create two reactive values (selectedData and clusters) and provide them to the client using ojs_define(). The plot will be automatically re-drawn on the client side when these values change."

This provides a reasonable separation of concerns, and prevents excess network traffic in the case that you have large OJS variables.\nHowever, if you want to use other OJS variables as Shiny inputs this is also possible using the ojs-export option. The default behavior maps to the following configuration:\n---\nserver:\n  type: shiny\n  ojs-export: viewof\n---\nYou can also specify ojs-export: all to cause all OJS reactives to be bound to Shiny inputs:\n---\nserver:\n  type: shiny\n  ojs-export: all\n---\nAlternatively, you can specify a list of OJS reactives by name (including using ~ to filter out reactives), and optionally combine this with the viewof and/or all options. For example:\n---\nserver:\n  type: shiny\n  ojs-export: [all, ~large_dataset]\n---\n\n\nShiny to OJS\nLess common but occasionally useful is the ability to bind Shiny inputs into OJS. By default no such bindings occur, however you can use the ojs-import option to opt-in for specific Shiny inputs. For example:\n---\nserver: \n  type: shiny\n  ojs-import: [minimum, maximum]\n---"

Here we look at how penguin body mass varies across both sex and species (use the provided inputs to filter the dataset by bill length and island):\n\nfiltered = transpose(data).filter(function(penguin) {\n  return bill_length_min < penguin.bill_length &&\n         islands.includes(penguin.island);\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof bill_length_min = Inputs.range(\n  [32, 50], \n  {value: 35, step: 1, label: \"Bill length (min):\"}\n)\nviewof islands = Inputs.checkbox(\n  [\"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\", \"Dream\"], \n  { value: [\"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\"], \n    label: \"Islands:\"\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot.rectY(filtered, \n  Plot.binX(\n    {y: \"count\"}, \n    {x: \"body_mass\", fill: \"species\", thresholds: 20}\n  ))\n  .plot({\n    facet: {\n      data: filtered,\n      x: \"sex\",\n      y: \"species\",\n      marginRight: 80\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.frame(),\n    ]\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the source code for this example. First we create an {ojs} cell that reads in some data from a CSV file using a FileAttachment:\n```{ojs}\ndata = FileAttachment(\"palmer-penguins.csv\").csv({ typed: true })\n```\nThe example above doesn’t plot all of the data but rather a filtered subset. To create our filter we’ll need some inputs, and we’ll want to be able to use the values of these inputs in our filtering function. To do this, we use the viewof keyword and with some standard Inputs:\n```{ojs}\nviewof bill_length_min = Inputs.range(\n  [32, 50], \n  {value: 35, step: 1, label: \"Bill length (min):\"}\n)\nviewof islands = Inputs.checkbox(\n  [\"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\", \"Dream\"], \n  { value: [\"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\"], \n    label: \"Islands:\"\n  }\n)\n```\nNow we write the filtering function that will transform the data read from the CSV using the values of bill_length_min and island.\n```{ojs}\nfiltered = data.filter(function(penguin) {\n  return bill_length_min < penguin.bill_length &&\n         islands.includes(penguin.island);\n})\n```\nHere we see reactivity in action: we don’t need any special syntax to refer to the dynamic input values, they “just work”, and the filtering code is automatically re-run when the inputs change. This works in much the same way a spreadsheet works when you update a cell and other cells that refer to it are recalculated.\nFinally, we’ll plot the filtered data using Observable Plot (an open-source JavaScript library for quick visualization of tabular data):\n```{ojs}\nPlot.rectY(filtered, \n  Plot.binX(\n    {y: \"count\"}, \n    {x: \"body_mass\", fill: \"species\", thresholds: 20}\n  ))\n  .plot({\n    facet: {\n      data: filtered,\n      x: \"sex\",\n      y: \"species\",\n      marginRight: 80\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.frame(),\n    ]\n  }\n)\n```\nNote that as with our inputs, we refer to the filtered variable with no special syntax—the plotting code will be automatically re-run whenever filtered changes (which in turn is updated whenever an input changes).\nThat covers a basic end-to-end use of OJS (see the Penguins examples for the full source code).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you take a look at the Penguins code, you’ll notice something curious: the inputs and plotting code are defined before the data processing code. This demonstrates a critical difference between OJS cell execution and traditional notebooks: cells do not need to be defined in any particular order.\nBecause execution is fully reactive, the runtime will automatically execute cells in the correct order based on how they reference each other. This is more akin to a spreadsheet than a traditional notebook with linear cell execution."

File attachments support many formats including CSV, TSV, JSON, SQLite, and Arrow so are a convenient way to read a dataset that has already been prepared for analysis.\nFrequently though you’ll need to do some pre-processing of your data in Python or R before it’s ready for visualization. Within Quarto, you can do this pre-processing during document render then make the results available to OJS.\nUse the ojs_define() function from Python or R to define variables that you want to use within JavaScript. For example, to reproduce the simple CSV read in Python you might do this:\n\n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\npenguins = pd.read_csv(\"palmer-penguins.csv\")\nojs_define(data = penguins)\n```\n\n\n\n\nThe call to ojs_define(data = penguins) says that we want to make a variable named data (with the value of the penguins data frame) available to OJS\nDepending on the visualization library you use, one additional step may be required to consume the data from JavaScript. In this case, the Plot function expects data by row rather than by column, so we transpose() it before filtering:\n```{ojs}\nfiltered = transpose(data).filter(function(penguin) {\n  return bill_length_min < penguin.bill_length &&\n         islands.includes(penguin.island);\n})\n```\nSee the article on Data Sources to learn more about the various ways to prepare and read data."

When rendered this will create an index.md, which in turn will ensure that Hugo treats it as a Page Bundle (automatically copying images and other referened resources to the publish directory).\nAdd the requisite Hugo front matter, then also specify format: hugo and any other required Quarto options.\n\nFor example, let’s say we wanted to create a new article named hello-quarto within the content directory. The filesystem would look like this:\nmysite/\n  content/\n    hello-quarto/\n      index.qmd\nHere’s what the source code of index.qmd might look like:\n---\ntitle: Hello, Quarto\ndate: \"2012-04-06\"\ncategories: \n  - Matplotlib\n  - Coordinates\nformat: hugo\njupyter: python3\n---\n\n## Polar Axis\n\nFor a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.\n\n```{python}\n#| label: fig-polar\n#| fig-cap: \"A line plot on a polar axis\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```"

For example:\nformat:\n  hugo:\n    html-math-method: webtex\nThe webtex method works for any web page that can display images, and requires no special JavaScript or CSS. Any inline or display equations contained within your document will be converted to an image URL that requests a rendered version of the equation. For example, the following markdown:\n$x + 1$\nWill be converted to:\n![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x%20%2B%201)\n\nDark Background\nSVG is used as the default rendering method because it has the best overall appearance.

When rendering a website, Quarto will produce a JSON file (search.json in the site output directory) which can be used to update an Algolia index. For more on creating indexes with Algolia, see Send and Update Your Data using Algolia.\n\nBasic Configuration\nIn order for Quarto to connect to your Algolia index, you need to provide basic connection information in your Quarto project file. You can find this connection information for your Algolia index in the Dashboard in the API Keys section. The following basic connection information is required:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nindex-name\nThe name of the index to use when performing a search.\n\n\napplication-id\nThe unique ID used by Algolia to identify your application.\n\n\nsearch-only-api-key\nThe Search-Only API key to use to connect to Algolia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBe sure to use the Search Only API key, which provides read only access to your index and is safe to include in project files. Never use your Admin API key in a Quarto document or project.\n\n\n\n\nshow-logo\nDisplays a ‘search by Algolia’ logo in the footer of search results.\n\n\n\nFor example:\nwebsite:\n  search:\n    algolia:\n      index-name: <my-index-name>\n      application-id: <my-application-id>\n      search-only-api-key: <my-search-only-api-key>\n\n\nCustom Index Schema\nIf you are simply using the search.json file generated by Quarto as your Algolia index, the above configuration information is all that is required to set up search using Algolia.\nHowever, if you are generating an index in some other fashion, you may need to provide additional information to specify which fields Quarto should use when searching. You do this by including an index-fields key under algolia which specifies the names of specific fields in your index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nhref\nThe field to use to read the URL to this index entry. The user will be navigated to this URL when they select the matching search result. Note that Quarto groups results by URL (not including the anchor when grouping).\nThis field is required (either as an existing field in your index or with a mapped field name).\n\n\ntitle\nThe field to use to read the title of the index entry.\nThis field is required (either as an existing field in your index or with a mapped field name).\n\n\ntext\nThe field to use to read the text of the index entry.\nThis field is required (either as an existing field in your index or with a mapped field name).\n\n\nsection\nThe field to use to read the section of the index entry. Quarto groups results by URL and uses the section information (if present) to show matching subsections of the same document.\nThis field is optional.\n\n\n\nAny or all of the above may be specified in your Quarto project file. For example:\nwebsite:\n  search:\n    algolia:\n      index-name: <my-index-name>\n      application-id: <my-application-id>\n      search-only-api-key: <my-search-only-api-key>\n      index-fields:\n        href: url\n        section: sec\n        text: body\n\n\nAlgolia Insights\nBy default, Algolia provides a number of insights based upon the performance of your Algolia search. In addition, it may be helpful to understand more detailed tracking of the results that are viewed and clicked. You can enable click and conversion tracking using Algolia by setting the analytics-events to true:\nwebsite:\n  search:\n    algolia:\n      index-name: <my-index-name>\n      application-id: <my-application-id>\n      search-only-api-key: <my-search-only-api-key>\n      analytics-events: true\nYou can confirm that events are being properly sent to Algolia using the Event Debugger.

You can enable this using:\nwebsite:\n  page-navigation: true\nWhen enabled, page navigation will be displayed at the bottom of the page whenever there is a next or previous page (including in the next or previous section). This option is enabled by default for books but not for websites.\n\nSeparators\nIf you include a page separator in the sidebar (either between sections or items), page navigation controls will not appear to continue pagination across the separator. For example, in the following sidebar:\nwebsite:\n  sidebar:\n    contents:\n      - section: \"First Section\"\n      - contents:\n        - href: document1.qmd\n        - href: document2.qmd\n        - href: document3.qmd\n      - section: \"---\"\n      - section: \"Second Section\"\n        contents:\n          - href: document4.qmd\n          - href: document5.qmd\n          - href: document6.qmd\nWhen the user reaches the bottom of document3.qmd, they will see previous navigation to go back to document2.qmd, but they will not see next navigation to continue onto document 4. This behavior is useful when you have sections of contents that don’t naturally flow together in sequential order. Use the separator to denote this in the sidebar with a horizontal line and to break up pagination."

Browser default 404 pages can be pretty stark, so you may want to create a custom page with a more friendly message and perhaps pointers on how users might find what they are looking for.\nMost web serving platforms (e.g. Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.) will use a file named 404.html in the root of your website as a custom error page if you provide it. You can include a custom 404 page in a Quarto website by creating a markdown file named 404.qmd in the root of your project. For example:\n---\ntitle: Page Not Found\n---\n\nThe page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).\n\nYou may want to try searching to find the page's new location.\nNote that you can use HTML alongside markdown within your 404.qmd file in order to get exactly the appearance and layout you want.\nYour 404 page will appear within the chrome of your site (e.g. fonts, css, layout, navigation, etc.). This is so that users don’t feel that they’ve irrecoverably “left” your site when they get a 404 error. If you don’t want this behavior, then provide a 404.html rather than 404.qmd.\nHere are some examples of how various popular websites handle custom 404 pages: https://blog.fluidui.com/top-404-error-page-examples/.\n\nNon-Root Site Paths\nIf your website is served from the root of a domain (e.g. https://example.com/) then simply providing a 404.qmd file as described above is all that’s required to create a custom 404 page.\nHowever, if your website is not served from the root of a domain then you need to provide one additional bit of configuration to make sure that resources (e.g. your site’s CSS) are resolved correctly within 404 pages.\nFor example, if your site is served from https://example.com/mysite/ then you’d add the following to your project website configuration within _quarto.yml:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"My Site\"\n  site-path: \"/mysite/\"\nNote that if you are already providing a site-url (which is required for generation of sitemaps and social metadata preview images) then it’s enough to simply include the path within the site-url:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"My Site\"\n  site-url: \"https://example.com/mysite/\""

A similar problem can also arise when a blog has multiple contributors and not everyone has the right software (or the right versions) to render all of the posts. Finally, posts that include computations can often take a while to render, and you don’t want the cumulative time required to render the site to grow too large.\nThe solution to these problems is to freeze the output of computational blog posts. When a post is rendered with freeze: true, the markdown output from the the underlying engine (e.g. Jupyter or Knitr) is saved. When the entire site is rendered these computations are not re-run, but rather read from the previously frozen results.\nThe only time an article with freeze: true is rendered is when you explicitly re-render it. By specifying this option for blog posts you can ensure that posts rendered now will always re-render well with the rest of the site, even if the software required to originally render them isn’t available.\nIn the default blog we include a file (_metadata.yml) that establishes shared metadata for all documents within the posts directory. In this file, we specify that we want freeze: true set by default for all posts:\n# options apply to all posts in this folder\n\n# freeze computational output\nfreeze: true\nSee the article on the freeze option to learn more about freezing computational output within websites."

MailChimp, for example, provides HTML like this for a minimal subscription widget.\n<span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">Subscribe</span>\n\n<!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->\n<link href=\"http://cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/slim-10_7_dtp.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n    #mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;  width:170px;}\n    /* Add your own Mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block.\n       We recommend moving this block and the preceding CSS link to the HEAD of your HTML file. */\n    #mc-embedded-subscribe-form{margin-left:-5px;}\n</style>\n<div id=\"mc_embed_signup\">\n<form action=\"<site_url>\" method=\"post\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" name=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" class=\"validate\" target=\"_blank\" novalidate>\n    <div id=\"mc_embed_signup_scroll\">\n\n    <input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" class=\"email\" id=\"mce-EMAIL\" placeholder=\"email address\" required>\n    <!-- real people should not fill this in and expect good things - do not remove this or risk form bot signups-->\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; left: -5000px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"b_f718424fc5df77c22533bdaa6_a3c37fb57b\" tabindex=\"-1\" value=\"\"></div>\n        <div class=\"optionalParent\">\n            <div class=\"clear foot\" style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">\n                <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" name=\"subscribe\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe\" class=\"button\">\n                <p class=\"brandingLogo\"></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</form>\n</div>\n\n<!--End mc_embed_signup-->\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe above widget HTML will not work in your blog as the subscription HTML needs to contain value specific to your blog. See your email service provider’s instructions for generating a subscription widget.\n\n\nCreate the file subscribe.html in the root of your project.\nPaste the HTML for your subscription widget into subscribe.html and save the file.\nAdd subscribe.html to the margin-header in your _quarto.yml file:\nwebsite:\n  # (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\n  margin-header: subscribe.html\n\nThe result looks like this:"

Use the favicon option to provide the path to a favicon image. For example:\nwebsite:\n  favicon: logo.png\n\n\nTwitter Cards\nTwitter Cards provide an enhanced appearance when someone links to your site on Twitter. When a link to your site is included in a Tweet, Twitter automatically crawls your site and fetches any Twitter Card metadata. To enable the automatic generation of Twitter Card metadata for your site, you can add the following to your _quarto.yml configuration file:\nwebsite:\n  twitter-card: true\nIn this case, Quarto will automatically generate a title, description, and preview image for the content. For more information about how Quarto finds preview images, see Preview Images.\nYou may also provide additional metadata to be used when generating the Twitter Card, including:\n\n\n\nKey\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntitle\nThe title of the page. Quarto will automatically use the title metadata from the page metadata. If you’d like you can override this just for the Twitter Card by including a title in the twitter-card metadata.\n\n\ndescription\nA short description of the content. Quarto will automatically use the description metadata from the page metadata. If you’d like you can override this just for the Twitter Card by including a description in the twitter-card metadata.\n\n\nimage\nThe path to a preview image for this content. By default, Quarto will use the image value from the site: metadata. If you provide an image, you may also optionally provide an image-width and image-height to improve the appearance of your Twitter Card.\nIf image is not provided, Quarto will automatically attempt to locate a preview image. For more information, see Preview Images.\n\n\ncard-style\nEither summary or summary_large_image. If this is not provided, the best style will automatically selected based upon other metadata. You can learn more about Twitter Card styles here.\n\n\ncreator\n@username of the content creator. Note that strings with special characters such as @ must be quoted in yaml.\n\n\nsite\n@username of website. Note that strings with special characters such as @ must be quoted in yaml.\n\n\n\nHere is a more comprehensive example of specifying Twitter Card metadata in a quarto.yml file:\nwebsite:\n  twitter-card:\n    creator: \"@dragsonstyle\"\n    site: \"@rstudio\"\nQuarto will automatically merge global metadata found in the website: twitter-card key with any metadata provided in the document itself in the twitter-card key. This is useful when you need to specify a mix of global options (for example, site) with per document options such as title or image.\n\n\nOpen Graph\nThe Open Graph protocol is a specification that enables richer sharing of links to articles on the web. It will improve the previews of your content when a link to it is pasted into applications like Slack, Discord, Facebook, Linkedin, and more. To enable the automatic generation of Open Graph metadata for your content, include the following in your _quarto.yml configuration file:\nwebsite:\n  opengraph: true\nIn this case, Quarto will automatically generate a title, description, and preview image for the content. For more information about how Quarto finds preview images, see Preview Images.\nYou may also provide additional metadata to be used when generating the Open Graph metadata, including:\n\n\n\nKey\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntitle\nThe title of the page. Quarto will automatically use the title metadata from the page metadata. If you’d like you can override this just for the Open Graph metadata by including a title in the open-graph metadata.\n\n\ndescription\nA short description of the content. Quarto will automatically use the description metadata from the page metadata. If you’d like you can override this just for the Open Graph metadata by including a description in the open-graph metadata.\n\n\nimage\nThe path to a preview image for this content. By default, Quarto will use the image value from the site: metadata. If you provide an image, you may also optionally provide an image-width and image-height.\nIf image is not provided, Quarto will automatically attempt to locate a preview image. For more information, see Preview Images.\n\n\nlocale\nThe locale that the Open Graph metadata is marked up in.\n\n\nsite-name\nThe name which should be displayed for the overall site. If not explicitly provided in the open-graph metadata, Quarto will use the site:title value.\n\n\n\nHere is a more comprehensive example of specifying Open Graph metadata in a quarto.yml file:\nwebsite:\n  open-graph:\n    locale: es_ES\n    site-name: Quarto\nQuarto will automatically merge global metadata found in the website: open-graph key with any metadata provided in the document itself in the open-graph key. This is useful when you need to specify a mix of global options (for example, site) with per document options such as title or image.\n\n\nPreview Images\nYou can specify a preview image for your article in several different ways:\n\nYou can explicitly provide a full url to the preview image using the image field in the appropriate metadata. For example:\ntitle: \"My Document\"\ntwitter-card:\n  image: \"https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/tools.png\"\nYou may provide a document relative path to an image (such as images/preview-code.png) or a project relative path to an image (such as /images/preview-code.png). If you provide a relative path such as this, you must also provide a site-url in your site’s metadata. For example in your _quarto.yml configuration file:\nwebsite:\n  site-url: \"https://www.quarto.org\"\nand in your document front matter:\ntitle: \"My Document\"\ntwitter-card:\n  image: \"/docs/websites/images/tools.png\"\nAny image that is being rendered in the page may also be used as a preview image by giving it the class name preview-image. Quarto will select the first image it finds with this class. For example, the following image will be used as the preview image when included on a page:\n![](images/tools.png){.preview-image}\nIf you label an image with this class, you must also provide a site-url in your site’s metadata.\nIf none of the above ways of specifying a preview image have been used, Quarto will attempt to find a preview image by looking for an image included in the rendered document with one of the following names: preview.png, feature.png, cover.png, or thumbail.png."

For example:\nlisting:\n  template: custom.ejs\n  contents:\n    - items.yml\nwhere the contents of items.yml is:\n- name: First Item\n  href: https://www.quarto.org\n  custom-field: A custom value\n- name: Second Item\n  href: https://www.rstudio.org\n  custom-field: A second custom value\n\nTemplate Examples\nPortions of this website are built using custom listings. The best place to start is with our gallery, which is a listing built using a custom template and a metadata file. You can view the source code used to create the gallery page in our Github repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngallery.yml\nThe metadata that controls what items are displayed in the gallery listing.\n\n\ngallery.ejs\nThe template used to display the items on the page.\n\n\nindex.qmd\nThe Quarto document that configures and positions the listing in the #gallery div."

    "text": "Sorting, Filtering, and Pagination\nBy default, sorting, filtering, and pagination are disabled for custom listings templates, but with some simple changes to your template and listing options, you can add this capability to your custom listing. To do this, you need to include the following three things in your custom template:\n\nInclude a list class on the HTML tag that contains the list of items.\nFor each item, include <%= metadataAttrs(item) %> in the HTML tag that contains the item. This will allow Quarto write custom attributes that are used for sorting and filtering.\nWithin each item, include a class that identifies the tag whose text represents the contents of an item’s field. The class must be the name of the field prefixed with listing-, for example the tag whose inner text is the item.name should include a class listing-name.\n\nFor example, we can modify the above custom.ejs template as follows:\n```{=html}\n<ul class=\"list\">\n<% for (const item of items) { %>\n  <li <%= metadataAttrs(item) %>>\n    <a href=\"<%- item.href %>\" class=\"listing-name\"><%= item.name %></a><br/>\n    <span class=\"listing-custom-field\"><%= item['custom-field'] %><span>\n  </li>\n<% } %>\n</ul>\n```\nOnce you have included these items in your template, can you then enable the options in your listing:\nlisting:\n  sort-ui: true\n  filter-ui: true\n  page-size: 10\nThe UI elements will now appear on the page and should interact properly with your custom listing.\n\nField Display Names\nYou may want to provide a custom display name for your field to provide a better name than the field name. For example, the field name would appear in the sort UI. You can use field-display-names to create mapping from a field to a display name. For example:\nlisting:\n  template: custom.ejs\n  contents:\n    - items.yml\n  sort-ui: true\n  filter-ui: true\n  page-size: 10\n  field-display-names:\n    name: \"Name\"\n    custom-field: \"Custom\"\n\n\nDate Sorting and Formatting\nTo properly format and sort date values, you can specify type information for fields in your items. If you specify a field is a date, it will automatically be formatted using the specified date formatting (either default or specified using date-format) and will support date sorting in ascending or descending order. If you specific a field as a number, it will support ascending and descending numeric sorting.\nYou and specify field types as follows\nlisting:\n  template: custom.ejs\n  contents:\n    - items.yml\n  field-types:\n    custom-date: date\n    custom-number: number\n\n\nRequired Fields\nSince listings are generated using fields that are specified in other documents or via metadata, it can be helpful to ensure that required fields are present. You can note required fields as following:\nlisting:\n  template: custom.ejs\n  contents:\n    - items.yml\n  field-required: [name, custom-field]\nIf the listing page is rendered an any of contents are missing a value for either of the required fields, an error will be thrown noting the field that is required and the file or metadata that has omitted it."

    "text": "The overarching goal of Quarto is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better. We hope to do this in several dimensions:\n\nCreate a writing and publishing environment with great integrated tools for technical content. We want to make authoring with embedded code, equations, figures, complex diagrams, interactive widgets, citations, cross references, and the myriad other special requirements of scientific discourse straightforward and productive for everyone.\nHelp authors take full advantage of the web as a connected, interactive platform for communications, while still providing the ability to create excellent printed output from the same document source. Researchers shouldn’t need to choose between LaTeX, MS Word, and HTML but rather be able to author documents that target all of them at the same time.\nMake reproducible research and publications the norm rather than the exception. Reproducibility requires that the code and data required to create a manuscript are an integrated part of it. However, this isn’t often straightforward in practice—Quarto aims to make it easier to adopt a reproducible workflow than not.\n\nQuarto is open source software licensed under the GNU GPL v2. We believe that it’s better for everyone if the tools used for research and science are free and open. Reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and the leveling of the playing field by eliminating cost barriers are but a few of the shared benefits of free software in science."

    "text": "Project\nAt the core of Quarto is Pandoc, a powerful and flexible document processing tool. Quarto adds a number of facilities to Pandoc aimed at scientific and technical publishing, including:\n\nEmbedding code and output from Python, R, and JavaScript via integration with Jupyter, Knitr, and Observable.\nA variety of extensions to Pandoc markdown useful for technical writing including cross-references, sub-figures, layout panels, hoverable citations and footnotes, callouts, and more.\nA project system for rendering groups of documents at once, sharing options across documents, and producing aggregate output like websites and books.\n\nDevelopment of Quarto is sponsored by RStudio, PBC, where we previously created a similar system (R Markdown) that shared the same goals, but was targeted principally at users of the R language. The same core team works on both Quarto and R Markdown:\n\nJ.J. Allaire (@jjallaire)\nChristophe Dervieux (@cderv)\nCarlos Scheidegger (@cscheid)\nCharles Teague (@dragonstyle)\nYihui Xie (@yihui)\n\nWith Quarto, we are hoping to bring these tools to a much wider audience.\nQuarto is a registered trademark of RStudio.
