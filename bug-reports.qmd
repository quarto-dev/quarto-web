We want to hear about Quarto bugs and, we want to fix those bugs! The following guidance will help us be as efficient as we can.

## Rule 0: Please submit your bug report anyway!

We have a better chance to fix your code quickly if you follow the instructions below. Still, we know that this takes work and isn't always possible.

**We would rather have a record of the problem than not know about it**.

We appreciate bug reports even if you are unable to take any or all of the following steps:

## Small is beautiful: Aim for a single document with \~10 lines

The most helpful thing you can do to help us is to provide a minimal, self-contained, and reproducible example.

- **minimal**: This will often mean turning your large website project into a project with a single small document, and a single large `.qmd` file into a small (ideally, about 10-20 total lines of code) example. By doing this, you might also be able to learn more specifically what the problem is.
- **self-contained**: The more software dependencies we need to understand and install, the harder it is to track the bug down. As you reduce the code, remove as many dependencies as possible.
- **reproducible**: If we cannot run your example, we cannot track the bug down. Please make sure the file you submitted is enough to trigger the bug on its own.

### Formatting: Make GitHub's markdown work for us {#formatting-make-githubs-markdown-work-for-us}

You can share a **minimal** **self-contained** **reproducible** Quarto document using the following markdown syntax, _i.e._, using more backticks than you have in your document (usually four ` ```` `) to account for code cells.

## Don't hold back: Tell us anything you think might make a difference

Although we want the `.qmd` file to be small, we still can use as much information from you as you're willing to share. Tell us all!, including:

- The version of Quarto you're running
- The operating system you're running
- The IDE you're using, and its version

### Check

You can provide the output (within a code block) of the following command to help us understand your environment:

```bash
quarto check
```

For instance, the markdown code you would provide might look like this:

````md
```bash

### Print stack

If you are seeing an error from Quarto, you can also provide additional diagnostic information by defining the `QUARTO_PRINT_STACK` environment variable. 

For example on Unix: 

```bash
export QUARTO_PRINT_STACK=true
quarto render document.qmd
```

or on Windows in a Powershell Terminal

```powershell
$ENV:QUARTO_PRINT_STACK="true"
quarto render document.qmd
```
